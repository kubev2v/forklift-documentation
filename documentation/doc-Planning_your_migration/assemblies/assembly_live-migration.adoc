[role="_abstract"]
You can use _live migration_ to migrate VMs between {virt} clusters or namespaces on the same {virt} cluster with minimal downtime. Live migration makes it easier to perform Day 2 tasks, such as maintenance and workload balancing after you have migrated your VMs to {virt}.

Live migration is supported by {project-first} version 2.10.0 and later. It requires {virt} 4.20 or later on both your source and target clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There is a known issue with live migration: Migration between namespaces on the same {virt} cluster fails because of MAC address collisions.
