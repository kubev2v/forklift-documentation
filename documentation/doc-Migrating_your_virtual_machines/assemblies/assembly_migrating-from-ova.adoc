== About OVA import

[NOTE]
====
OVA import is intended for migrating supported guest operating systems exported from VMware vSphere. The process utilizes `virt-v2v` to prepare the guest OS for KVM.

Vendor-supplied appliances (for example, networking or security appliances) are not recommended for OVA import. They often use proprietary bootloaders or disk layouts that are incompatible with this conversion, and converting a vendor OVA may invalidate vendor support agreements. To ensure stability and vendor support, use the vendor's native `.qcow2` or KVM image via the OpenShift Virtualization "Upload Image" or "Import from URL" workflow instead of the MTV OVA path.
====

== Prerequisites

* You have planned your migration from OVA.
