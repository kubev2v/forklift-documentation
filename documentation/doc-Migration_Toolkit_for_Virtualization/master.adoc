== About {the-lc} {project-full}

You can use {the-lc} {project-first} to migrate virtual machines from the following source providers to {virt} destination providers:

* VMware vSphere
* {rhv-full} ({rhv-short})
* {osp}
* Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) that were created by VMware vSphere
* Remote {virt} clusters

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to ensure that your environment is prepared for migration.

[id="mtv-software-requirements_{context}"]
=== Software requirements

{project-first} has software requirements for all providers as well as specific software requirements per provider.

[id="mtv-software-requirements-all-providers_{context}"]
==== Software requirements for all providers

You must install xref:compatibility-guidelines_{context}[compatible versions] of {ocp} and {virt}.

[id="additional-authentication-for-osp_{context}"]
==== Additional authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers

{project-short} versions 2.6 and later support the following authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers in addition to the standard username and password credential set:

* Token authentication
* Application credential authentication

You can use these methods to migrate virtual machines with {osp} source providers using the command-line interface (CLI) the same way you migrate other virtual machines, except for how you prepare the `Secret` manifest.

You can install the {operator-name} by using the {ocp} web console or the command-line interface (CLI).

In {project-first} version 2.4 and later, the {operator-name} includes the {project-short} plugin for the {ocp} web console.

After you install the {operator-name} by using either the {ocp} web console or the CLI, you can configure the Operator.

[id="migrating-vms-mtv-ui_{context}"]
=== Migrating virtual machines using the MTV user interface

Use the {project-short} user interface to migrate VMs from the following providers:

* VMware vSphere
* {rhv-full} ({rhv-short})
* {osp}
* Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) that were created by VMware vSphere
* {virt} clusters

For all migrations, you specify the source provider, the destination provider, and the migration plan. The specific procedures vary per provider.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that all xref:prerequisites_{context}[prerequisites] are met.

VMware only: You must have the minimal set of xref:vmware-privileges_{context}[VMware privileges].

VMware only: Creating a xref:creating-vddk-image_{context}[VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK)] image will increase migration speed.

=== Migrating virtual machines

You migrate virtual machines (VMs) using the command-line interface (CLI) by creating {project-short} custom resources (CRs). The CRs and the migration procedure vary by source provider.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must specify a name for cluster-scoped CRs.

You must specify both a name and a namespace for namespace-scoped CRs.

To migrate to or from an {ocp-short} cluster that is different from the one the migration plan is defined on, you must have an {virt} service account token with `cluster-admin` privileges.

=== Creating custom rules for the Validation service

The `Validation` service uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy rules to check the suitability of each virtual machine (VM) for migration. The `Validation` service generates a list of _concerns_ for each VM, which are stored in the `Provider Inventory` service as VM attributes. The web console displays the concerns for each VM in the provider inventory.

You can create custom rules to extend the default ruleset of the `Validation` service. For example, you can create a rule that checks whether a VM has multiple disks.
