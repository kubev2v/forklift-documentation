<p>Forklift 2.7 has the following resolved issues:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="resolved-issues-2-7-10_forklift">Resolved issues 2.7.10</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">OVN secondary network not working with Multus default network override</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, the OVN secondary network was not working with Multus default network override. This issue caused the importer pod to become stuck, as the importer pod was created when there were multiple networks and the wrong default network override annotation was configured. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.10. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1645">(MTV-1645)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Retain IP field description misleading to customers</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, it was difficult to understand the user interface relating to the <strong>Preserve IPs</strong> VM setting in the chosen setting mode. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.10. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1743">(MTV-1743)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Persistent TPM is always added to the Windows 2022 VM after conversion</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when migrating a Windows Server 2022 VMware virtual machine (VM) to KubeVirt, the VMI had the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) module configured, even though the module was not configured in the original VM. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.10. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1939">(MTV-1939)</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="resolved-issues-2-7-9_forklift">Resolved issues 2.7.9</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Forklift controller panic in the inventory</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, the <code>forklift-contoller</code> inventory container would panic, and the VM would not be migrated. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.9. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1610">(MTV-1610)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">vCenter sessions keep on increasing during migration plan execution</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when migrating virtual machines (VMs) from VMware vSphere 7 to KubeVirt, vCenter sessions kept increasing. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.9. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1929">(MTV-1929)</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="resolved-issues-2-7-8_forklift">Resolved issues 2.7.8</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Forklift not handling OVA NFS URL if it does not contain <code>:</code> char</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, the character <code>:</code> in the NFS URL of OVAs was not handled, which created malformed URLs. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.8. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1856">(MTV-1856)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Changing the host migration network returns an unexpected error</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when changing the network from <strong>VMkernel</strong> to <strong>Management network</strong>, the migration network changed. However, an error message was returned that the request could not be completed <code>due to an incorrect user name or password</code>. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.8. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1862">(MTV-1862)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migrating RHEL VMs with LUKS disk fail at DiskTransferV2v stage</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, migrating Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machines (VMs) with disks encrypted with Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) enabled from VMWare fails at the <strong>DiskTransferV2v</strong> stage.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Q35 machine type is hard-coded during import from vSphere</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, VMs imported from vSphere always had the Q35 machine type set. However, the machine type is <code>floating</code>, and thus the VM application binary interface (ABI) can change between reboots. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.8. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1865">(MTV-1865)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><code>memory.requests</code> and <code>memory.guest</code> are set during import from VMware</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, Forklift imported VMs with the <code>requests.memory</code> field and the <code>memory.guest</code> field set. This was problematic as it prevented memory overcommit, memory hot-plug, and caused unnecessary memory pressure on VMs that could lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.8. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1866">(MTV-1866)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><code>virt-v2v</code> failure when converting dual-boot VM</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">VDDK validator fails to launch in environments with quota set</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, after creating a migration plan from a VMware provider, the VDDK validation failed due to a <code>LimitRange</code> not being provided to add requests and limits to any container that do not define them. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.7, with Forklift setting limits by default to make the migration plan work out of the box. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1493">(MTV-1493)</a></p>

<p>Forklift 2.7 has the following known issues:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><code>Select Migration Network</code> from the endpoint type <code>ESXi</code> displays multiple incorrect networks</div>
<p>When you choose <code>Select Migration Network</code>, from the endpoint type of <code>ESXi</code>, multiple incorrect networks are displayed. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1291">(MTV-1291)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">VMs with Secure Boot enabled might not be migrated automatically</div>
<p>Virtual machines (VMs) with Secure Boot enabled currently might not be migrated automatically. This is because Secure Boot, a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to ensure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), would prevent the VMs from booting on the destination provider. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Workaround: The current workaround is to disable Secure Boot on the destination. For more details, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot?view=windows-11">Disabling Secure Boot</a>. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1548">(MTV-1548)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Windows VMs which are using <code>Measured Boot</code> cannot be migrated</div>
<p>Microsoft Windows virtual machines (VMs), which are using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/measured-boot">Measured Boot</a> feature, cannot be migrated because Measured Boot is a mechanism to prevent any kind of device changes, by checking each start-up component, including the firmware, all the way to the boot driver.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The alternative to migration is to re-create the Windows VM directly on KubeVirt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration of a VM with Secure Boot enabled VM migration results in a VM with Secure Boot disabled</div>
<p>When migrating a virtual machine (VM) with <strong>Secure Boot</strong> enabled, the VM has <strong>Secure Boot</strong> as <code>disabled</code> after being migrated. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.7.7. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1632">(MTV-1632)</a></p>

<div class="title">OVN secondary network is not functioning as expected with the Multus default network override</div>
<p>The secondary network of Open Virtual Network (OVN) does not function as expected with the Multus default network override. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1645">(MTV-1645)</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Network and Storage maps in the UI are not correct when created from the command line</div>
<p>When creating <strong>Network</strong> and <strong>Storage</strong> maps from the UI, the correct names are not shown in the UI. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1421">(MTV-1421)</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration fails with module <code>network-legacy</code> configured in RHEL guests</div>
<p>Migration fails if the module configuration file is available in the guest and the <code>dhcp-client</code> package is not installed, returning a <code>dracut module 'network-legacy' will not be installed, because command 'dhclient' could not be found</code> error. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1615">(MTV-1615)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Harden grub2-mkconfig to avoid overwriting <code>/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</code></div>
<p>In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, there has been a significant change in how GRUB is handled on UEFI systems. Previously, the GRUB configuration file, <code>/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</code>, was used on UEFI systems. However, in RHEL 9, this file now serves as a stub that dynamically redirects to the GRUB configuration, located at <code>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</code>. This behavior is expected in RHEL 9.4, but has been resolved in RHEL 9.5. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-32099">(RHEL-32099)</a></p>
