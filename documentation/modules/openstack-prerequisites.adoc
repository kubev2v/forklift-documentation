The following prerequisites apply to {osp} migrations:

* You must use a xref:compatibility-guidelines_{context}[compatible version] of {osp}.

{project-short} versions 2.6 and later support the following authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers in addition to the standard username and password credential set:

* Token authentication
* Application credential authentication

You can use these methods to migrate virtual machines with {osp} source providers using the command-line interface (CLI) the same way you migrate other virtual machines, except for how you prepare the `Secret` manifest.
