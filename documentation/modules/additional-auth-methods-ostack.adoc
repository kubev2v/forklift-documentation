= Additional authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers

{project-short} versions 2.6 and later support the following authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers in addition to the standard username and password credential set:

* Token authentication
* Application credential authentication

You can use these methods to migrate virtual machines with {osp} source providers using the CLI the same way you migrate other virtual machines with one exception: You need to prepare the `Secret` manifest as described in xref:openstack-token-authentication_ostack[Using token authentication with an {osp} source provider] or xref:openstack-application-credential-authentication_ostack[Using application credential authentication with an {osp} source provider].
