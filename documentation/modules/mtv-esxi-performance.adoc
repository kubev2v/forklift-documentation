[id="mtv-esxi-performance_{context}"]
= ESXi performance

[role="_abstract"]
ESXi performance can be measured for a single ESXI host or for multiple ESXi hosts.

[id="mtv-single-esxi-host-performance_{context}"]
== Single ESXi host performance

Test migration by using the same ESXi host.

In each iteration, the total VMs increase to display the impact of concurrent migration on the duration.

The results show that migration time is linear when increasing the total VMs (50 GiB disk, Utilization 70%).

The optimal number of VMs per ESXi is 10.

== Multiple ESXi hosts and a single data store

In each iteration, the number of ESXi hosts was increased, to show that increasing the number of ESXi hosts improves the migration time (50 GiB disk, Utilization 70%).
