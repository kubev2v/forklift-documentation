= Using the must-gather tool

[role="_abstract"]
You can collect logs and information about {project-short} custom resources (CRs) by using the `must-gather` tool. You must attach a `must-gather` data file to all customer cases.

You can gather data for a specific namespace, migration plan, or virtual machine (VM) by using the filtering options.

[NOTE]
====
If you specify a non-existent resource in the filtered `must-gather` command, no archive file is created.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to the {virt} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have the {ocp} CLI (`oc`) installed. For more information, see {ocp-doc}/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the {ocp-short} CLI].

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather}
----
+
The data is saved as `/must-gather/must-gather.tar.gz`. You can upload this file to a support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

. Optional: Run the `oc adm must-gather` command with the following options to gather filtered data:

* Namespace:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather} \
  -- NS=<namespace> /usr/bin/targeted
----

* Migration plan:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather} \
  -- PLAN=<migration_plan> /usr/bin/targeted
----

* Virtual machine:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather} \
  -- VM=<vm_id> NS=<namespace> /usr/bin/targeted <1> 
----
<1> Specify the VM _ID_ as it appears in the `Plan` CR.
