= {project-short} cold migration and warm migration introduction

Cold migration is when a powered *_off_* virtual machine (VM) is migrated to a separate host. The VM is powered off, and there is no need for common shared storage.

Warm migration is when a powered *_on_* VM is migrated to a separate host. A source host state is cloned to the destination host.

.Warm migrations precopy stage

. Create an initial snapshot of running VM disks.
. Copy first snapshot to target: full-disk transfer, the largest amount of data copied.  It takes more time to complete.
. Copy deltas: changed data, copying only data that has changed since the last snapshot was taken. It takes less time to complete.
.. Create a new snapshot.
.. Copy the delta between the previous snapshot and the new snapshot.
.. Schedule the next snapshot, configurable by default, one hour after the last snapshot finished.
. An arbitrary number of deltas can be copied.


.Warm migration cutover stage

. Scheduled time to finalize warm migration
. Shut down the source VM.
. Copy the final snapshot delta to the target.
. Continue in the same way as cold migration
.. Guest conversion
.. Starting target VM (optional)

|Duration
|Each block is copied once.
|Blocks may be copied multiple times.

|Fail fast
|Convert and then transfer.
|Transfer and then convert.

|Tools
a|`virt-v2v` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9), used to convert virtual machines from a foreign hypervisor to run on Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVMs).
a|Containerized Data Importer (CDI), a persistent storage management add-on, and `virt-v2v` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9)

|VM downtime
|The VMs are shut down, and the disks are transferred.
|Disks are transferred in the background. The VMs are shut down during the cutover stage, and the remaining data is migrated. Data stored in RAM is not migrated.

|Parallelism
|Disks are transferred sequentially for each VM. For remote migration, disks are transferred in parallel.
footnoteref:[footnote1,Remote migration: Target environment that does not have MTV installed. Migration to a remote environment using CDI.]
|Disks are transferred in parallel by different pods.

|Connection use
|Keeps the connection to the Source only during the disk transfer.
|Keeps the connection to the Source during the disk transfer, but the connection is released between snapshots.
