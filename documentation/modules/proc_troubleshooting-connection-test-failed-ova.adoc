= Resolving OVA connection test errors

[role="_abstract"]
When you create an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) provider in the {project-short} UI, `ConnectionTestFailed` error messages might be displayed before the provider status changes to `Ready`.

The error messages are misleading and do not accurately reflect the in-progress status of the connection test.

.Procedure

. Wait for the provider status to update. If the provider configuration is correct, the status will change to `Ready` despite the temporary error messages.

. If the status does not change to `Ready` after several minutes, verify your OVA provider configuration:
+
.. Check that the OVA URL or path is correct and accessible.
.. Verify network connectivity to the OVA storage location.
.. Ensure that any required authentication credentials are correct.

. If the issue persists, check the forklift controller logs for more detailed error information:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-mtv deployment/forklift-controller
----

. Correct any configuration issues identified and update the provider.

.Verification

. Navigate to *Providers* in the {project-short} UI.
. Verify that the OVA provider shows a status of `Ready`.
. Attempt to create a migration plan using the OVA provider to confirm it is accessible.
