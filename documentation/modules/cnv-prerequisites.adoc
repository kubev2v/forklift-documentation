[role="_abstract"]
To migrate between {virt} clusters, verify that both clusters have matching {project-first} versions and the source uses {virt} 4.16 or later. You can migrate forward to newer {virt} versions if both are compatible with your {project-short} version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended to migrate only between clusters with the same version of {virt}, although migration from an earlier version of {virt} to a later one is supported.
