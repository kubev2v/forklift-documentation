[role="_abstract"]
{virt} cluster migrations require matching MTV versions on source and destination clusters, and {virt} 4.16 or later on the source. Migration to earlier {virt} versions is unsupported. Forward migration is supported if both versions are compatible with the current MTV version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended to migrate only between clusters with the same version of {virt}, although migration from an earlier version of {virt} to a later one is supported.
