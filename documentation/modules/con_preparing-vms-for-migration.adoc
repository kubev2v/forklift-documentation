= Preparing VMs for migration

[role="_abstract"]
Before running a migration plan, you can prepare your virtual machines to ensure a successful migration. The {project-short} web console provides tools to help you configure VM settings in advance.

Common preparation tasks include:

* *Renaming VMs*: Ensure VM names comply with DNS naming requirements for the target {virt} environment.
* *Configuring power states*: Set the target power state for VMs after migration to control whether they start automatically or remain powered off.

You can perform these tasks after creating a migration plan but before running the migration. The changes you make apply to the target VMs in the destination environment.
