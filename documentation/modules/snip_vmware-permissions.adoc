[IMPORTANT]
====
When you specify the user permissions only on the VM, the `forklift-controller` consistently fails to reconcile a migration plan, and subsequently returns an HTTP 500 error. 

In {project-short}, you must add permissions at the data center level, which includes storage, networks, switches, and so on, which are used by the VM. You must then propagate the permissions to the child elements.

If you do not want to add this level of permissions, you must manually add the permissions to each object on the VM host required.
