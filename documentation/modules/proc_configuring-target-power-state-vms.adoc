= Configuring the target power state of VMs

[role="_abstract"]
You can set the power state of a target VM to `off`, `on`, or `auto` either in the MTV UI or in the `spec.vms` section of the `Plan` Custom Resource (CR). The `auto` setting preserves the power state of the source VM.

You can apply different post-migration power states to different VMs in a single migration plan.


.Procedure
. Configure the power state for target VMs in the MTV UI.
.. In the Create migration plan wizard, navigate to *Other settings* under *Additional setup* in the left navigation pane.
.. Scroll down to *VM target power state*.
.. Select *Auto*, *Powered on*, or *Powered off* from the dropdown menu to apply the setting to all VMs in your migration plan. You can customize the power state for selected VMs when your plan is created.
.. Click *Next*, and verify that the correct power state shows for *VM target power state* under *Other settings (optional)*.
.. When you create your migration plan, click *Migration plans* in the left navigation menu, and open the *Plan Details* page for your migration plan.
.. Verify that the correct power state shows for the *VM target power state* field. You can click the *Edit* icon to change the power state.
.. Click the *Virtual Machines* tab to view a table of all VMs from the configured source provider.
.. Click *Manage columns* to select *Target power state* and display the column.
.. To change the power state for a specific VM, click the *More* icon at the end of the row for the VM, and click *Edit target power state*.
.. Select and save a new power state for the VM. 

. Configure the power state for target VMs in the YAML file.
.. In the Red Hat OpenShift web console, click *Migration for Virtualization* > *Migration plans*.
.. Open the *Plan Details* page for your migration plan.
.. Click the *YAML* tab to open the *Plan* custom resource (CR) for your migration plan.
.. For each VM under *vms* in the YAML file, enter the target power state. In this example, you set a different target power state for each VM:
