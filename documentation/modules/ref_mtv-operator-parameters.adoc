|Parameter |Description |Default value

|`controller_max_vm_inflight`
a|The maximum number of disks or VMs that can transfer or migrate simultaneously. Varies with provider. For more information, see xref:ref_max-concurrent-vms_{context}[Configuring the controller_max_vm_inflight parameter]. 
|`20`

|`must_gather_api_cleanup_max_age`
|The duration in hours for retaining `must gather` reports before they are automatically deleted.
|`-1` (disabled)

|`controller_container_limits_cpu`
|The CPU limit allocated to the main controller container.
|`500m`

|`controller_container_limits_memory`
|The memory limit allocated to the main controller container.
|`800Mi`

|`controller_precopy_interval`
|The interval in minutes at which a new snapshot is requested before initiating a warm migration.
|`60`

|`controller_snapshot_status_check_rate_seconds`
|The frequency in seconds with which the system checks the status of snapshot creation or removal during a warm migration.
|`10`

|`controller_filesystem_resource usage`
|Percentage of space in persistent volumes allocated as file system resource usage when the `storageclass` is `filesystem`.

*`ForkliftController` CR only.*
|`10`

|`controller_block_resource usage`
|Fixed amount of additional space allocated in persistent block volumes. This setting is applicable for any `storageclass` that is block-based. It can be used when data, such as encryption headers, is written to the persistent volumes in addition to the content of the virtual disk.

*`ForkliftController` CR only.*
|`0`

|`vsphere_osmap_configmap_name`
|Config map for vSphere source providers. This config map maps the operating system of the incoming VM to a {virt} preference name. This config map needs to be in the namespace where the {project-short} Operator is deployed.

To see the list of preferences in your {virt} environment, open the {ocp-name} web console and click *Virtualization* > *Preferences*.

Add values to the config map when this parameter has the default value, `forklift-vsphere-osmap.` To override or delete values, specify a config map that is different from `forklift-vsphere-osmap`.

*`ForkliftController` CR only.*
|`forklift-vsphere-osmap`

|`ovirt_osmap_configmap_name`
|Config map for {rhv-short} source providers. This config map maps the operating system of the incoming VM to a {virt} preference name. This config map needs to be in the namespace where the {project-short} Operator is deployed.

To see the list of preferences in your {virt} environment, open the {ocp-name} web console and click *Virtualization* -> *Preferences*.

You can add values to the config map when this parameter has the default value, `forklift-ovirt-osmap.` To override or delete values, specify a config map that is different from `forklift-ovirt-osmap`.

*`ForkliftController` CR only.*
|`forklift-ovirt-osmap`

|`controller_retain_precopy_importer_pods`
|Whether to retain importer pods so that the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) does not delete them during migration.

*`ForkliftController` CR only.*
|`false`

|`controller_transfer_network`
|The `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` used for data transmission.
|Default transfer network
