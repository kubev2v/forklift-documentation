= Cloning methods used by storage copy offload

[role="_abstract"]
You can use either of the following two cloning (copying) methods to run storage copy offload migrations: vSphere Installation on Bundle (VIB) or SSH. Both use the volume populator named `vsphere-xcopy-volume-populator` to perform `vmkfstools` clone operations on ESXi hosts.

vSphere Installation on Bundle (VIB) is the default method. This method uses a custom VIB installed on ESXi hosts to expose `vmkfstools` operations via the vSphere API.

SSH is the recommended method. This method uses SSH to directly run `vmkfstools` commands on ESXi hosts. This method is useful when VIB installation is not possible and for the advantages that follow.

== Advantages of the SSH method

The SSH method offers you the following advantages:

- No VIB installation: Does not require custom VIB deployment on ESXi hosts
- Standard SSH: Uses the standard ESXi SSH service with no custom components
- Security: Uses secure key-based authentication with command restrictions
- Compatibility: Works with any ESXi version that supports SSH
- Flexibility: Easier to troubleshoot and monitor SSH connections
