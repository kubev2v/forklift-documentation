= Target VM scheduling prerequisites

[role="_abstract"]
Migrations that use target VM scheduling require the following prerequisites, in addition to the prerequisites for your source provider:

* {project-first} 2.10 or later.
* Version of {virt} that is compatible with your version of {project-short}. For {project-short} 2.10, the compatible versions of {virt} are 4.18, 4.19, and 4.20 only.
* `cluster-admin` or equivalent security privileges that allow managing `VirtualMachineInstance` objects and associated Kubernetes scheduling primitives.
