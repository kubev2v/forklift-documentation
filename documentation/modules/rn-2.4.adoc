= {project-full} 2.4

Migrate virtual machines (VMs) from VMware vSphere or {rhv-full} or {osp} to {virt} with {the-lc} {project-first}.

The release notes describe technical changes, new features and enhancements, and known issues.

[id="technical-changes-24_{context}"]
== Technical changes

This release has the following technical changes:

.Faster disk image migration from {rhv-short}

Disk images are not converted anymore using virt-v2v when migrating from {rhv-short}. This change speeds up migrations and also allows migration for guest operating systems that are not supported by virt-vsv. link:https://github.com/kubev2v/forklift-controller/issues/403[(forklift-controller#403)]

.Faster disk transfers by ovirt-imageio client (ovirt-img)

Disk transfers use `ovirt-imageio` client (ovirt-img) instead of Containerized Data Import (CDI) when migrating from RHV to the local OpenShift Container Platform cluster, accelerating the migration.

.Faster migration using conversion pod disk transfer

When migrating from vSphere to the local OpenShift Container Platform cluster, the conversion pod transfers the disk data instead of Containerized Data Importer (CDI), accelerating the migration.

.Migrated virtual machines are not scheduled on the target OCP cluster

The migrated virtual machines are no longer scheduled on the target OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This enables migrating VMs that cannot start due to limit constraints on the target at migration time.

.StorageProfile resource needs to be updated for a non-provisioner storage class

You must update the `StorageProfile` resource with `accessModes` and `volumeMode` for non-provisioner storage classes such as NFS.

.VDDK 8 can be used in the VDDK image

Previous versions of {project-short} supported only using VDDK version 7 for the VDDK image. {project-short} supports both versions 7 and 8, as follows:

* If you are migrating to OCP 4.12 or earlier, use VDDK version 7.
* If you are migrating to OCP 4.13 or later, use VDDK version 8.

[id="new-features-and-enhancements-24_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release has the following features and improvements:

.OpenStack migration

{project-short} now supports migrations with {osp} as a source provider. This feature is a provided as a Technology Preview and only supports cold migrations.

.OCP console plugin

The {project-full} Operator now integrates the {project-short} web console into the {ocp} web console. The new UI operates as an OCP Console plugin that adds the sub-menu `Migration` to the navigation bar. It is implemented in version 2.4, disabling the old UI. You can enable the old UI by setting `feature_ui: true` in ForkliftController. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-427[(MTV-427)]

.Skip certification option

'Skip certificate validation' option was added to VMware and {rhv-short} providers. If selected, the provider's certificate will not be validated and the UI will not ask for specifying a CA certificate.

.Only third-party certificate required

Only the third-party certificate needs to be specified when defining a {rhv-short} provider that sets with the Manager CA certificate.

.Conversion of VMs with RHEL9 guest operating system

Cold migrations from vSphere to a local Red Hat OpenShift cluster use virt-v2v on RHEL 9. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-332[(MTV-332)]

[id="known-issues-24_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Deleting migration plan does not remove temporary resources

Deleting a migration plan does not remove temporary resources such as importer pods, conversion pods, config maps, secrets, failed VMs and data volumes. You must archive a migration plan before deleting it to clean up the temporary resources. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018974[(BZ#2018974)]

.Unclear error status message for VM with no operating system

The error status message for a VM with no operating system on the *Plans* page of the web console does not describe the reason for the failure. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008846[(BZ#22008846)]

.Log archive file includes logs of a deleted migration plan or VM

If deleting a migration plan and then running a new migration plan with the same name, or if deleting a migrated VM and then remigrate the source VM, then the log archive file created by the {project-short} web console might include the logs of the deleted migration plan or VM. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2023764[(BZ#2023764)]

.Migration of virtual machines with encrypted partitions fails during conversion

vSphere only: Migrations from {rhv-short} and OpenStack don't fail, but the encryption key may be missing on the target OCP cluster.

.Snapshots that are created during the migration in OpenStack are not deleted

The Migration Controller service does not delete snapshots that are created during the migration for source virtual machines in OpenStack automatically. Workaround: the snapshots can be removed manually on OpenStack.

.{rhv-short} snapshots are not deleted after a successful migration

The Migration Controller service does not delete snapshots automatically after a successful warm migration of a {rhv-short} VM. Workaround: Snapshots can be removed from {rhv-short} instead. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-349[(MTV-349)]

.Migration fails during precopy/cutover while a snapshot operation is executed on the source VM

Some warm migrations from {rhv-short} might fail. When running a migration plan for warm migration of multiple VMs from {rhv-short}, the migrations of some VMs might fail during the cutover stage. In that case, restart the migration plan and set the cutover time for the VM migrations that failed in the first run.

Warm migration from {rhv-short} fails if a snapshot operation is performed on the source VM. If the user performs a snapshot operation on the source VM at the time when a migration snapshot is scheduled, the migration fails instead of waiting for the userâ€™s snapshot operation to finish. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-456[(MTV-456)]

.Cannot schedule migrated VM with multiple disks to more than one storage classes of type hostPath

When migrating a VM with multiple disks to more than one storage classes of type hostPath, it may result in a VM that cannot be scheduled. Workaround: It is recommended to use shared storage on the target OCP cluster.

.Deleting migrated VM does not remove PVC and PV

When removing a VM that was migrated, its persistent volume claims (PVCs) and physical volumes (PV) are not deleted. Workaround: remove the CDI importer pods and then remove the remaining PVCs and PVs. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-492[(MTV-492)]

.PVC deletion hangs after archiving and deleting migration plan

When a migration fails, its PVCs and PVs are not deleted as expected when its migration plan is archived and deleted. Workaround: Remove the CDI importer pods and then remove the remaining PVCs and PVs. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-493[(MTV-493)]

.VM with multiple disks may boot from non-bootable disk after migration

VM with multiple disks that was migrated might not be able to boot on the target OCP cluster. Workaround: Set the boot order appropriately to boot from the bootable disk. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-433[(MTV-433)]

.Non-supported guest operating systems in warm migrations

Warm migrations and migrations to remote OCP clusters from vSphere do not support all types of guest operating systems that are supported in cold migrations to the local OCP cluster. It is a consequence of using RHEL 8 in the former case and RHEL 9 in the latter case.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[Converting virtual machines from other hypervisors to KVM with virt-v2v in RHEL 7, RHEL 8, and RHEL 9] for the list of supported guest operating systems.

.VMs from vSphere with RHEL 9 guest operating system may start with network interfaces that are down

When migrating VMs that are installed with RHEL 9 as guest operating system from vSphere, their network interfaces could be disabled when they start in OpenShift Virtualization. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-491[(MTV-491)]

.Upgrade from 2.4.0 fails

When upgrading from MTV 2.4.0 to a later version, the operation fails with an error that says the field 'spec.selector' of deployment `forklift-controller` is immutable. Workaround: remove the custom resource `forklift-controller` of type `ForkliftController` from the installed namespace, and recreate it. The user needs to refresh the OCP Console once the `forklift-console-plugin` pod runs to load the upgraded {project-short} web console. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-518[(MTV-518)]

[id="resolved-issues-24_{context}"]
== Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

.Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol. In previous releases of MTV, the HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection, which resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.

This issue has been resolved in MTV 2.4.3 and 2.5.2. It is advised to update to one of these versions of MTV or later.


For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487 (Rapid Reset Attack)] and link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39325[CVE-2023-39325 (Rapid Reset Attack)].


.Improve invalid/conflicting VM name handling

Improve the automatic renaming of VMs during migration to fit RFC 1123. This feature that was introduced in 2.3.4 is enhanced to cover more special cases. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-212[(MTV-212)]

.Prevent locking user accounts due to incorrect credentials

If a user specifies an incorrect password for {rhv-short} providers, they are no longer locked in {rhv-short}. An error returns when the {rhv-short} manager is accessible and adding the provider. If the {rhv-short} manager is inaccessible, the provider is added, but there would be no further attempt after failing, due to incorrect credentials. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-324[(MTV-324)]

.Users without cluster-admin role can create new providers

Previously, the `cluster-admin` role was required to browse and create providers. In this release, users with sufficient permissions on MTV resources (providers, plans, migrations, NetworkMaps, StorageMaps, hooks) can operate MTV without cluster-admin permissions. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-334[(MTV-334)]

.Convert i440fx to q35

Migration of virtual machines with i440fx chipset is now supported. The chipset is converted to q35 during the migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-430[(MTV-430)]

.Preserve the UUID setting in SMBIOS for a VM that is migrated from {rhv-short}

The Universal Unique ID (UUID) number within the System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) no longer changes for VMs that are migrated from {rhv-short}. This enhancement enables applications that operate within the guest operating system and rely on this setting, such as for licensing purposes, to operate on the target OCP cluster in a manner similar to that of {rhv-short}. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-597[(MTV-597)]

.Do not expose password for {rhv-short} in error messages

Previously, the password that was specified for {rhv-short} manager appeared in error messages that were displayed in the web console and logs when failing to connect to {rhv-short}. In this release, error messages that are generated when failing to connect to {rhv-short} do not reveal the password for {rhv-short} manager.

.QEMU guest agent is now installed on migrated VMs

The QEMU guest agent is installed on VMs during cold migration from vSphere. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018062[(BZ#2018062)]
