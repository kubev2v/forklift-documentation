The high-level workflow shows the migration process from the point of view of the user.

The workflow describes the following steps:

. You create a source provider, a target provider, a network mapping, and a storage mapping.
. You create a migration plan that includes the following resources:
* Source provider
* Target provider
* Network mapping
* Storage mapping
* One or more virtual machines (VMs)

. You run a migration plan by creating a `Migration` CR that references the `Plan` CR. If a migration is incomplete, you can run a migration plan multiple times until all VMs are migrated.
. For each VM in the migration plan, the Migration Controller creates a `VirtualMachine` CR and records the progress of the migration in its `status` subresource. When all VMs have been migrated, the Migration Controller sets the status of the migration plan to `Completed`. The power state of a source VM is maintained after migration.
