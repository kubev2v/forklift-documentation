[id="resolved-issues-2-7-12_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.12

.The static route gateway of Windows VMs is passed as the default gateway during migration
In earlier releases of {project-short}, the static route gateway of Windows virtual machines (VMs) was passed as the default gateway during migration instead of the actual default gateway. This caused VMs to be incorrectly configured. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.12. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2418[(MTV-2418)] 

[id="resolved-issues-2-7-11_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.11

.Main controller container of forklift controller crashes during VMware migrations

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the main controller container of `forklift-container` crashed during VMware migrations because users created snapshots of the virtual machines (VMs) during migrations. As a result, some VMs migrated, but others failed to migrate. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.11, but users are cautioned not to create snapshots of VMs during migrations. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2164[(MTV-2164)]

[id="resolved-issues-2-7-10_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.10

.OVN secondary network not working with Multus default network override

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the OVN secondary network was not working with Multus default network override. This issue caused the importer pod to become stuck, as the importer pod was created when there were multiple networks and the wrong default network override annotation was configured. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.10. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1645[(MTV-1645)]

.Retain IP field description misleading to customers

In earlier releases of {project-short}, it was difficult to understand the user interface relating to the *Preserve IPs* VM setting in the chosen setting mode. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.10. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1743[(MTV-1743)]

.Persistent TPM is always added to the Windows 2022 VM after conversion

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when migrating a Windows Server 2022 VMware virtual machine (VM) to {virt}, the VMI had the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) module configured, even though the module was not configured in the original VM. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.10. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1939[(MTV-1939)]


[id="resolved-issues-2-7-9_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.9

.Forklift controller panic in the inventory

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the `forklift-contoller` inventory container would panic, and the VM would not be migrated. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.9. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1610[(MTV-1610)]

.vCenter sessions keep on increasing during migration plan execution

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when migrating virtual machines (VMs) from VMware vSphere 7 to {virt}, vCenter sessions kept increasing. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.9. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1929[(MTV-1929)]


[id="resolved-issues-2-7-8_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.8

.{project-short} not handling OVA NFS URL if it does not contain `:` char

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the character `:` in the NFS URL of OVAs was not handled, which created malformed URLs. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.8. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1856[(MTV-1856)]

.Changing the host migration network returns an unexpected error

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when changing the network from *VMkernel* to *Management network*, the migration network changed. However, an error message was returned that the request could not be completed `due to an incorrect user name or password`. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.8. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1862[(MTV-1862)]

.Migrating RHEL VMs with LUKS disk fail at DiskTransferV2v stage

In earlier releases of {project-short}, migrating Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machines (VMs) with disks encrypted with Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) enabled from VMWare fails at the *DiskTransferV2v* stage. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.8. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1864[(MTV-1864)]

.Q35 machine type is hard-coded during import from vSphere

In earlier releases of {project-short}, VMs imported from vSphere always had the Q35 machine type set. However, the machine type is `floating`, and thus the VM application binary interface (ABI) can change between reboots. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.8. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1865[(MTV-1865)]

.`memory.requests` and `memory.guest` are set during import from VMware

In earlier releases of {project-short}, {project-short} imported VMs with the `requests.memory` field and the `memory.guest` field set. This was problematic as it prevented memory overcommit, memory hot-plug, and caused unnecessary memory pressure on VMs that could lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.8. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1866[(MTV-1866)]

.`virt-v2v` failure when converting dual-boot VM

In earlier releases of {project-short}, there was an issue when attempting the migration of a VM with two disks with two different operating systems installed in a dual-boot configuration. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.8. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1877[(MTV-1877)]

[id="resolved-issues-2-7-7_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.7

.{project-short} Controller waiting for snapshot creation

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when performing a warm migration using 200 VMs, the {project-short} Controller could pause the migration during snapshot creation. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.7. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1775[(MTV-1775)]

.Extended delay in time taken for VMs to start migration

In earlier releases of {project-short}, in some situations there was an extended delay before all VMs started to migrate. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.7. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1774[(MTV-1774)]

.Warm migration plan with multi-VMs from ESXi host provider fails in cutover phase

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the migration plan with multi-VMs from an ESXi host provider failed in the cutover phase. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.7. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1753[(MTV-1753)]

.SecureBoot enabled VM in migrated with SecureBoot disabled

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when migrating a virtual machine (VM) with Secure Boot *enabled*, the VM had Secure Boot *disabled* after being migrated. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.7. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1632[(MTV-1632)]

.VDDK validator fails to launch in environments with quota set

In earlier releases of {project-short}, after creating a migration plan from a VMware provider, the VDDK validation failed due to a `LimitRange` not being provided to add requests and limits to any container that do not define them. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.7, with {project-short} setting limits by default to make the migration plan work out of the box. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1493[(MTV-1493)]


[id="resolved-issues-2-7-6_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.6

.Warning if preserve static IP is mapped to pod network

In earlier releases of {project-short}, there was no warning message for preserving static IPs while using Pod networking. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.6. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1503[(MTV-1503)]

.Schedule the cutover for an archived plan is not allowed

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the option to schedule a cutover for an archived plan was currently available in the UI. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.6 with the cutover action disabled for an archived plan. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1729[(MTV-1729)]

.*Next* button misplaced in *Create new plan* wizard

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when creating a new Migration Plan with the *Create new plan* wizard, after filling in the form, the *Next* button was misplaced to the left of the *Back* option. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.6. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1732[(MTV-1732)]

.Static IP address is not preserved for Debian-based VMs that use interfaces

In earlier releases of {project-short}, all Debian-based operating systems could have the network configurations in the `/etc/network/interfaces`, but information was not fetched from these config files when creating the udev rule to set the interface name. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.6.  link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1711[(MTV-1711)]

.Editing of plan settings is enabled for all plan statuses

In earlier releases of {project-short}, VMS were removed from archived or archiving plans. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.6, and if a plan's status is either archiving or archived, the option to remove VMs for that plan is blocked. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1713[(MTV-1713)] 

.Warm migration fails to complete

In earlier releases of {project-short}, after the first *Disk Transfer* step set was completed, the cutover was set. However, during the *Image Conversion* step, not all data volumes were completed, with some of them being stuck in the *import in progress* phase and *100% progress*. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.6. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1717[(MTV-1717)]


[id="resolved-issues-2-7-5_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.5

.XFS filesystem corruption after warm migration of VM from VMware

In earlier releases of {project-short}, virtual machines (VM) were presenting XFS filesystem and other data corruption after the warm migration from VMware to {virt} using {project-short}. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.5. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1679[(MTV-1679)]

.Missing VM network-ID in the inventory

In earlier releases of {project-short}, after creating a migration plan for VMs with a NSX-T network attached from vSphere, the VM network mapping was missing, and also adding network mapping could not list NSX-T networks as source networks. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.5. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1695[(MTV-1695)] and link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1140[(MTV-1140)]

.Failure to create Windows 2019 VM during Cold Migration

In earlier releases of {project-short}, cold migrating Windows Server 2019 VM from {rhv-full} ({rhv-short}) to a remote cluster returned a `firmware.bootloader setting` error of `admission webhook "virtualmachine-validator.kubevirt.io" denied the request` during the *VirtualMachineCreation* phase. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.5. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1613[(MTV-1613)]

.PreferredEfi applied when BIOS already enabled within VirtualMachineInstanceSpec

In earlier releases of {project-short}, `PreferredUseEfi` was applied when the BIOS was already enabled within the `VirtualMachineInstanceSpec`. In MTV 2.7.5, `PreferredEfi` is only applied when a user has not provided their own EFI configuration and the BIOS is additionally not enabled. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-49381[(CNV-49381)]


[id="resolved-issues-2-7-4_{context}"]
== Resolved issues 2.7.4

.XFS filesystem corruption after warm migration of VM from VMware

In earlier releases of {project-short}, in some cases, the destination VMware virtual machine (VM) was observed to have XFS filesystem corruption after being migrated to {virt} using {project-short}. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.4. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1656[(MTV-1656)]

.Error `Did not find CDI importer pod for DataVolume` is recorded in the `forklift-controller` logs during the `CopyDisks` phase

.Large number of VMs in the inventory can cause the inventory controller to panic

In earlier releases of {project-short}, having a large number of virtual machines (VMs) in the inventory could cause the inventory controller to panic and return a `concurrent write to websocket connection` warning. This issue was caused by the concurrent write to the WebSocket connection and has been addressed by the addition of a lock, so the Go `routine` *waits* before sending the response from the server. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.3. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1220[(MTV-1220)]

.VM selection disappears when selecting multiple VMs in the Migration Plan

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the *VM selection* checkbox disappeared after selecting multiple VMs in the Migration Plan. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.3. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1546[(MTV-1546)]

.`forklift-controller` crashing during OVA plan migration

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the `forklift-controller` would crash during an OVA plan migration, returning a `runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` panic.  This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.3. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1577[(MTV-1577)]

.VMNetworksNotMapped error occurs after creating a plan from the UI with the source provider set to {virt}

In earlier releases of {project-short}, after creating a plan with an {virt} source provider, the Migration Plan failed with the error `The plan is not ready - VMNetworksNotMapped`. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1201[(MTV-1201)]

.Migration Plan for {virt} to {virt} missing the source namespace causing VMNetworkNotMapped error

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when creating a Migration Plan for an {virt} to {virt} migration using the Plan Creation Form, the network map generated was missing the source namespace, which caused a `VMNetworkNotMapped` error on the plan. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1297[(MTV-1297)]

.DV, PVC, and PV are not cleaned up and removed if the migration plan is Archived and Deleted

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the DataVolume (DV), PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and PersistentVolume (PV) continued to exist after the migration plan was archived and deleted. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1477[(MTV-1477)]

.Other migrations are halted from starting as the scheduler is waiting for the complete VM to get transferred

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when warm migrating a virtual machine (VM) that has several disks, you had to wait for the complete VM to get migrated, and the scheduler was halted until all the disks finished before the migration would be started. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1537[(MTV-1537)]

.Warm migration is not functioning as expected

In earlier releases of {project-short}, warm migration did not function as expected. When running the warm migration with VMs larger than the MaxInFlight disks, the VMs over this number did not start the migration until the cutover. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1543[(MTV-1543)]

.Migration hanging due to error: virt-v2v: error: -i libvirt: expecting a libvirt guest name

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when attempting to migrate a VMware VM with a non-compliant Kubernetes name, the Openshift console returned a warning that the VM would be renamed. However, after starting the Migration Plan, it hangs since the migration pod is in an `Error` state. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1555[(MTV-1555)]

.VMs are not migrated if they have more disks than MAX_VM_INFLIGHT

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when migrating the VM using the warm migration, if there were more disks than the `MAX_VM_INFLIGHT` the VM was not scheduled and the migration was not started. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1573[(MTV-1573)]

.Migration Plan returns an error even when Changed Block Tracking (CBT) is enabled

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when running a VM in VMware, if the  CBT flag was enabled while the VM was running by adding both `ctkEnabled=TRUE` and `scsi0:0.ctkEnabled=TRUE` parameters, an error message `Danger alert:The plan is not ready - VMMissingChangedBlockTracking` was returned, and the migration plan was prevented from working. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1576[(MTV-1576)]
