= How MTV uses the virt-v2v tool

The {project-first} uses the `virt-v2v` tool to convert the disk image of a VM into a format compatible with {virt}. The tool makes migrations easier because it automatically performs the tasks needed to make your VMs work with {virt}, such as enabling paravirtualized VirtIO drivers in the converted virtual machine, if possible, and installing the QEMU guest agent.

`virt-v2v` is included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) versions 7 and later.

[id="main-functions-virt-v2v-mtv_{context}"]
== Main functions of virt-v2v in MTV migrations

During migration, {project-short} uses `virt-v2v` to collect metadata about VMs, make necessary changes to VM disks, and copy the disks containing the VMs to {virt}.

`virt-v2v` makes the following changes to VM disks to prepare them for migration:

* Additions:

** Injection of VirtIO drivers, for example, network or disk drivers.
** Preparation of hypervisor-specific tools or agents, for example, a QEMU guest agent installation.
** Modification of boot configuration, for example, updated bootloader or boot entries.

* Removals:

** Unnecessary or former hypervisor-specific files, for example, VMware tools or VirtualBox additions.
** Old network driver configurations, for example, removing VMware-specific NIC drivers.
** Configuration settings that are incompatible with the target system, for example, old boot settings.

If you are migrating from VMware or from OVA files, `virt-v2v` also sets their IP addresses either during the migration or during the first reboot of the VMs after migration.

[NOTE]
====
You can also run pre-defined Ansible hooks before or after a migration using {project-short}. For more information, see xref:../master.adoc#adding-hooks-mtv-migration-plan[Adding hooks to an MTV migration plan].

These hooks do not necessarily use `virt-v2v`.

[id="customizing-removing-installing-virt-v2v_{context}"]
== Customizing, removing, and installing files

{project-short} uses `virt-v2v` to perform additional guest customizations during the conversion, such as the following actions:

* Customization to preserve IP addresses
* Customization to preserve drive letters

[NOTE]
====
For RHEL-based guests, `virt-v2v` attempts to install the guest agent from the Red Hat registry. If the migration is run in a detached environment, the installer will fail, and you must use hooks, or other automation, to install the guest agent.

[id="permissions-virt-v2v_{context}"]
== Permissions and virt-v2v

`virt-v2v` does not require permissions or access credentials for the guest operating system itself because `virt-v2v` is not run against a running VM, but only against the disks of a VM.
