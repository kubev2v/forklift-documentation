= {project-short} custom resources and services

{The} {project-first} is provided as an {ocp} Operator. It creates and manages the following custom resources (CRs) and services.

.{project-short} custom resources

* `Provider` CR stores attributes that enable {project-short} to connect to and interact with the source and target providers.
* `NetworkMapping` CR maps the networks of the source and target providers.
* `StorageMapping` CR maps the storage of the source and target providers.
* `Provisioner` CR stores the configuration of the storage provisioners, such as supported volume and access modes.
* `Plan` CR contains a list of VMs with the same migration parameters and associated network and storage mappings.
* `Migration` CR runs a migration plan.
+
Only one `Migration` CR per migration plan can run at a given time. You can create multiple `Migration` CRs for a single `Plan` CR.

.{project-short} services

* `Provider Inventory` service:
** Connects to the source and target providers.
** Maintains a local inventory for mappings and plans.
** Stores VM configurations.
** Runs the `Validation` service if a VM configuration change is detected.

* `Validation` service checks the suitability of a VM for migration by applying rules.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Validation service is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features
are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and
might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them
in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product
features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during
the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview
features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

* `User Interface` service:
** Enables you to create and configure {project-short} CRs.
** Displays the status of the CRs and the progress of a migration.

* `Migration Controller` service orchestrates migrations.
+
When you create a migration plan, the Migration Controller service validates the plan and adds a status label. If the plan fails validation, the plan status is `Not ready` and the plan cannot be used to perform a migration. If the plan passes validation, the plan status is `Ready` and it can be used to perform a migration. After a successful migration, the Migration Controller changes the plan status to `Completed`.

* `Virtual Machine Import Controller`, `Kubevirt Controller`, and `Containerized Data Import (CDI) Controller` services handle most technical operations.
