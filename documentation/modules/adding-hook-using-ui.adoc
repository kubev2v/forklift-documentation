= Adding a migration hook to a migration plan using the {ocp} web console

You can add a migration hook to an existing migration plan using the {ocp} web console. Note that you need to run one command in the {project-first} CLI.

For example, you can create a hook to install the `cloud-init` service on a VM and write a file before migration.

[NOTE]
====
You can run one pre-migration hook, one post-migration hook, or one of each per migration plan.
====

.Prerequisites

* Migration plan
* Migration hook file, whose contents you copy and paste into the web console
* File containing the `Secret` for the source provider
* {ocp} service account called by the hook and that has at least write access for the namespace you are working in
* SSH access for VMs you want to migrate with the public key installed on the VMs
* VMs running on Microsoft Server only: Remote Execution enabled

.Additional resources
For instructions for creating a service account, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/authentication/understanding-and-creating-service-accounts.html[Understanding and creating service accounts].

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, click *Migration* > *Plans for virtualization* and then click the migration plan you want to add the hook to.
. Click *Hooks*.
. For a pre-migration hook, perform the following steps:

.. In the *Pre migration hook* section, toggle the *Enable hook* switch to *Enable pre migration hook*.
.. Enter the *Hook runner image*. If you are specifying the `spec.playbook`, you need to use an image that has an `ansible-runner`.
.. Paste your hook as a YAML file in the *Ansible playbook* text box.

. For a post-migration hook, perform the following steps:

.. In the *Post migration hook*, toggle the *Enable hook* switch *Enable post migration hook*.
.. Enter the *Hook runner image*. If you are specifying the `spec.playbook`, you need to use an image that has an `ansible-runner`.
.. Paste your hook as a YAML file in the *Ansible playbook* text box.

. At the top of the tab, click *Update hooks*.
. In a terminal, enter the following command to associate each hook with your {ocp} service account:
