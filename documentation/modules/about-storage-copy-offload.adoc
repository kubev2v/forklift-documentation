= About migrating virtual machines by using storage copy offload

You can migrate VMware virtual machines (VMs) that are on a storage array more efficiently by using a method called _storage copy offload_.
This method uses an `XCOPY` command to copy VMs from the storage array to {virt} and is faster than other migration methods.  

This feature is available as a Development Preview for {project-first} 2.8.5 and is not available for shared disks.
