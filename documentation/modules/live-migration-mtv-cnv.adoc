= Live migration, {project-short}, and {virt}

[role="_abstract"]
Live migration combines {project-first} and {virt} capabilities. {project-short} orchestrates the migration, building resource inventories, creating migration plans, and ensuring shared resources are available. {virt} handles low-level mechanics like state and storage transfer.
