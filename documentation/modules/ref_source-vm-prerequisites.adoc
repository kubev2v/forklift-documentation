= Source VM prerequisites

[role="_abstract"]
Source VM prerequisites apply to all migrations from a source provider to {virt}. 

Prerequisites::

* ISO images and CD-ROMs are unmounted.
* Each NIC contains either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, although a NIC may use both.
* The OS of each VM is certified and supported as a guest OS for conversions.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can check that the OS is supported by referring to the table in link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[Converting virtual machines from other hypervisors to KVM with virt-v2v]. See the columns of the table that refer to RHEL 8 hosts and RHEL 9 hosts.
====
+
* VMs that you want to migrate with {project-short} 2.6._z_ run on RHEL 8.
* VMs that you want to migrate with {project-short} 2.7._z_ run on RHEL 9.
* VM names must be DNS-compliant and must be unique in the {virt} environment for a migration to succeed. You can rename source VMs in the {project-first} UI or {project-short} automatically adjusts the original VM name to meet requirements. For information about renaming VMs, see xref:proc_renaming-vms-for-migration_{context}[Renaming virtual machines for migration].
