It is strongly recommended to create a VDDK image to accelerate migrations. For more information, see xref:../master.adoc#creating-vddk-image_mtv[Creating a VDDK image].

include::snip_vmware-windows-vss.adoc[]

The following prerequisites apply to VMware migrations:

* You must use a xref:compatibility-guidelines_{context}[compatible version] of VMware vSphere.
* You must be logged in as a user with at least the minimal set of xref:vmware-privileges_{context}[VMware privileges].
* To access the virtual machine using a pre-migration hook, link:https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html[VMware Tools] must be installed on the source virtual machine.
* The VM operating system must be certified and supported for use as a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[guest operating system with {virt}] _and_ for link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[conversion to KVM with `virt-v2v`].
* If you are running a warm migration, you must enable link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128[changed block tracking (CBT)] on the VMs and on the VM disks.
* If you are migrating more than 10 VMs from an ESXi host in the same migration plan, you must increase the NFC service memory of the host.
* It is strongly recommended to disable hibernation because {project-first} does not support migrating hibernated VMs.


[IMPORTANT]
====
In the event of a power outage, data might be lost for a VM with disabled hibernation. However, if hibernation is not disabled, migration will fail
====

[NOTE]
====
Neither {project-short} nor OpenShift Virtualization support conversion of Btrfs for migrating VMs from VMWare.

== VMware privileges

The following minimal set of VMware privileges is required to migrate virtual machines to {virt} with the {project-first}.

2+a|`Virtual machine.Provisioning` privileges:
[NOTE]
====
All `Virtual machine.Provisioning` privileges are required.
