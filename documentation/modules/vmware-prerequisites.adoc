[role="_abstract"]
It is strongly recommended to create a VDDK image to accelerate migrations. For more information, see xref:creating-vddk-image_mtv[Creating a VDDK image].

[WARNING]
====
Virtual machine (VM) migrations do not work without VDDK when a VM is backed by {vmw} vSAN.
====

The following prerequisites apply to {vmw} migrations:

* You must use a xref:compatibility-guidelines_{context}[compatible version] of {vmw} vSphere.
* You must be logged in as a user with at least the minimal set of xref:vmware-privileges_{context}[VMware privileges].
* To access the virtual machine using a pre-migration hook, link:https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html[VMware Tools] must be installed on the source virtual machine.
* The VM operating system must be certified and supported for use as a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[guest operating system with {virt}] _and_ for link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[conversion to KVM with `virt-v2v`].
* If you are running a warm migration, you must enable link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128[changed block tracking (CBT)] on the VMs and on the VM disks.
* If you are migrating more than 10 VMs from an ESXi host in the same migration plan, you must increase the Network File Copy (NFC) service memory of the host.
* It is strongly recommended to disable hibernation because {project-first} does not support migrating hibernated VMs.

[WARNING]
====
For virtual machines (VMs) running Microsoft Windows, Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) inside the guest VM is used to quiesce the file system and applications. 

When performing a warm migration of a Microsoft Windows virtual machine from {vmw}, you must start VSS on the Windows guest operating system in order for the snapshot and `Quiesce guest file system` to succeed.

If you do not start VSS on the Windows guest operating system, the snapshot creation during the Warm migration fails with the following error:

[source,terminal]
----
An error occurred while taking a snapshot: Failed to restart the virtual machine
----

If you set the VSS service to `Manual` and start a snapshot creation with `Quiesce guest file system = yes`. In the background, the {vmw} Snapshot provider service requests VSS to start the shadow copy.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In case of a power outage, data might be lost for a VM with disabled hibernation. However, if hibernation is not disabled, migration will fail.
====

[NOTE]
====
Neither {project-short} nor OpenShift Virtualization support conversion of Btrfs for migrating VMs from {vmw}.

[id="vmware-privileges_{context}"]
== {vmw} privileges

The following minimal set of {vmw} privileges is required to migrate virtual machines to {virt} with the {project-first}.

[TIP]
==== 
Create a role in {vmw} with the permissions described in the preceding table and then apply this role to the *Inventory* section, as described in xref:creating-vmware-role-mtv-permissions_mtv[Creating a {vmw} role to apply {project-short} permissions].
