[role="_abstract"]
OVA migrations require files created by VMware vSphere. OVA files must be in NFS-shared directories, either as compressed OVF packages with `.ova` extensions or as extracted OVF packages. MTV scans root and first-level subfolders for compressed packages, and up to second-level subfolders for extracted packages.

[NOTE]
====
Migration of OVA files that were not created by {vmw} vSphere but are compatible with vSphere might succeed. However, migration of such files is not supported by {project-short}. {project-short} supports only OVA files created by {vmw} vSphere.
