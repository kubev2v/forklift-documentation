[id="technical-changes-25_{context}"]
== Technical changes

This release has the following technical changes:


.Migration from OpenStack moves to being a fully supported feature

In this version of {project-short}, migration using OpenStack source providers graduated from a Technology Preview feature to a fully supported feature.

.Disabling FIPS

EMS enforcement is disabled for migrations with VMware vSphere source providers to enable migrations from versions of vSphere that are supported by {project-short} but do not comply with the 2023 FIPS requirements.

.Integration of the create and update provider user interface

The user interface of create and update providers now aligns with the look and feel of the {ocp} web console and displays up-to-date data.

.Standalone UI

The old UI of MTV 2.3 cannot be enabled by setting `feature_ui: true` in ForkliftController anymore.

.Errors logged in populator pods are improved

In previous releases of {project-short} {project-version}, populator pods were always restarted on failure. This made it difficult to gather the logs from the failed pods. In {project-short} 2.5.3, the number of restarts of populator pods is limited to three times. On the third and final time, the populator pod remains in the fail status and its logs can then be easily gathered by must-gather and by forklift-controller to know this step has failed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-818[(MTV-818)]

[id="new-features-and-enhancements-25_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release has the following features and improvements:

.Migration using OVA files created by VMware vSphere


// i need to wait for this ticket to be merged to add a link
In {project-short} {project-version}, you can migrate using Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files that were created by VMware vSphere as source providers. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-336[(MTV-336)]

[NOTE]
====
Migration of OVA files that were not created by VMware vSphere but are compatible with vSphere might succeed. However, migration of such files is not supported by {project-short}. {project-short} supports only OVA files created by VMware vSphere.
====

include::snippet_ova_tech_preview.adoc[]

.Migrating VMs between {ocp} clusters

In {project-short} {project-version}, you can now use Red Hat {virt} provider as a source provider as well as a destination provider. You can migrate VMs from the cluster that MTV is deployed on to another cluster, or from a remote cluster to the cluster that {project-short} is deployed on. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-571[(MTV-571)]

.Migration of VMs with direct LUNs from RHV

During the migration from RHV, direct LUNs are detached from the source virtual machines and attached to the target virtual machines. Note that this mechanism does not work yet for Fibre Channel. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-329[(MTV-329)]

.Additional authentication methods for OpenStack

In addition to standard password authentication, the following authentication methods are supported: Token authentication and Application credential authentication. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-539[(MTV-539)]

.Validation rules for OpenStack

The validation service includes default validation rules for virtual machines from OpenStack. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-508[(MTV-508)]

.VDDK is now optional for VMware vSphere providers

The VMware vSphere source provider can now be created without specifying a VDDK `init` image. It is strongly recommended to create a VDDK `init` image to accelerate migrations.

.Deployment on OKE enabled

In {project-short} 2.5.3, deployment on OpenShift Kubernetes Engine (OKE) has been enabled. For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/welcome/oke_about.html[About OpenShift Kubernetes Engine]. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-803[(MTV-803)]

.Migration of VMs to destination storage classes with encrypted RBD now supported

In {project-short} 2.5.4, migration of VMs to destination storage classes that have encrypted RADOS Block Devices (RBD) volumes is now supported.

To make use of this new feature, set the value of the parameter `controller_block_overhead` to `1Gi`, following the procedure in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.5/html-single/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/index#configuring-mtv-operator_mtv[Configuring the MTV Operator]. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-851[(MTV-851)]

[id="known-issues-25_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Deleting migration plan does not remove temporary resources

Deleting a migration plan does not remove temporary resources such as importer pods, conversion pods, config maps, secrets, failed VMs and data volumes. You must archive a migration plan before deleting it to clean up the temporary resources. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018974[(BZ#2018974)]

.Unclear error status message for VM with no operating system

The error status message for a VM with no operating system on the *Plans* page of the web console does not describe the reason for the failure. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008846[(BZ#22008846)]

.Migration of virtual machines with encrypted partitions fails during conversion

vSphere only: Migrations from {rhv-short} and OpenStack do not fail, but the encryption key may be missing on the target {ocp} cluster.


.Migration fails during precopy/cutover while a snapshot operation is performed on the source VM

Warm migration from {rhv-short} fails if a snapshot operation is performed on the source VM. If a user performs a snapshot operation on the source VM at the time when a migration snapshot is scheduled, the migration fails instead of waiting for the userâ€™s snapshot operation to finish. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-456[(MTV-456)]

.Unable to schedule migrated VM with multiple disks to more than one storage classes of type hostPath

When migrating a VM with multiple disks to more than one storage classes of type `hostPath`, it might happen that a VM cannot be scheduled. Workaround: Use shared storage on the target {ocp} cluster.

.Non-supported guest operating systems in warm migrations

Warm migrations and migrations to remote {ocp} clusters from vSphere do not support all types of guest operating systems that are supported in cold migrations to the local {ocp} cluster. This is a consequence of using RHEL 8 in the former case and RHEL 9 in the latter case. +
See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[Converting virtual machines from other hypervisors to KVM with virt-v2v in RHEL 7, RHEL 8, and RHEL 9] for the list of supported guest operating systems.

.VMs from vSphere with RHEL 9 guest operating system may start with network interfaces that are down

When migrating VMs that are installed with RHEL 9 as guest operating system from vSphere, the network interfaces of the VMs could be disabled when they start in {ocp-name} Virtualization. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-491[(MTV-491)]

.Import OVA: ConnectionTestFailed message appears when adding OVA provider

When adding an OVA provider, the error message `ConnectionTestFailed` may instantly appear, although the provider is created successfully. If the message does not disappear after a few minutes and the provider status does not move to `Ready`, this means that the `ova server pod creation` has failed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-671[(MTV-671)]

[id="resolved-issues-25_{context}"]
== Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

.Flaw was found in jsrsasign package which is vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy

Versions of the package `jsrsasign` before 11.0.0, used in previous releases of {project-short}, are vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy in the RSA PKCS1.5 or RSA-OAEP decryption process. This discrepancy means an attacker could decrypt ciphertexts by exploiting this vulnerability. However, exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key. One proposed workaround is to find and replace RSA and RSA-OAEP decryption with another crypto library. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.5.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-26159[CVE-2023-26159].

.Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)

A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol. In previous releases of {project-short}, the HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection, which resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption.

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.2. It is advised to update to this version of MTV or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487 (Rapid Reset Attack)] and link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39325[CVE-2023-39325 (Rapid Reset Attack)].


.Gin Web Framework does not properly sanitize filename parameter of Context.FileAttachment function

A flaw was found in the Gin-Gonic Gin Web Framework, used by {project-short}. The filename parameter of the `Context.FileAttachment` function was not properly sanitized. This flaw in the package could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions caused by improper input validation by the filename parameter of the `Context.FileAttachment` function. A maliciously created filename could cause the `Content-Disposition` header to be sent with an unexpected filename value, or otherwise modify the `Content-Disposition` header.


This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.2. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-29401[CVE-2023-29401 (Gin-Gonic Gin Web Framework)] and link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-26125[CVE-2023-26125].


.CVE-2023-26144: mtv-console-plugin-container: graphql: Insufficient checks in the OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule.ts

A flaw was found in the package GraphQL from 16.3.0 and before 16.8.1. This flaw means {project-short}  versions before {project-short} 2.5.2 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to insufficient checks in the `OverlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule.ts` file when parsing large queries. This issue may allow an attacker to degrade system performance. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-712[(MTV-712)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.2. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-26144[CVE-2023-26144].


.CVE-2023-45142: Memory leak found in the otelhttp handler of open-telemetry

A flaw was found in `otelhttp handler` of OpenTelemetry-Go. This flaw means {project-short} versions before {project-short} 2.5.3 are vulnerable to a memory leak caused by `http.user_agent` and `http.method` having unbound cardinality, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to exhaust the server's memory by sending many malicious requests, affecting the availability. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-795[(MTV-795)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45142[CVE-2023-45142].


.CVE-2023-39322: QUIC connections do not set an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when reading post-handshake messages

A flaw was found in Golang. This flaw means {project-short} versions before {project-short} 2.5.3 are vulnerable to QUIC connections not setting an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious QUIC connection to cause unbounded memory growth. With the fix, connections now consistently reject messages larger than 65KiB in size. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-708[(MTV-708)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39322[CVE-2023-39322].


.CVE-2023-39321: Processing an incomplete post-handshake message for a QUIC connection can cause a panic

A flaw was found in Golang. This flaw means {project-short} versions before {project-short} 2.5.3 are vulnerable to processing an incomplete post-handshake message for a QUIC connection, which causes a panic. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-693[(MTV-693)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39321[CVE-2023-39321].


.CVE-2023-39319: Flaw in html/template package

A flaw was found in the Golang `html/template` package used in {project-short}. This flaw means {project-short} versions before {project-short} 2.5.3 are vulnerable, as the `html/template` package did not properly handle occurrences of `<script`, `<!--`, and `</script` within JavaScript literals in `<script>` contexts. This flaw could cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped, which could be leveraged to perform an `XSS` attack. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-693[(MTV-693)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39319[CVE-2023-39319].


.CVE-2023-39318: Flaw in html/template package

A flaw was found in the Golang `html/template` package used in {project-short}. This flaw means {project-short} versions before {project-short} 2.5.3 are vulnerable as the `html/template` package did not properly handle HMTL-like `""` comment tokens, nor hashbang `\#!` comment tokens. This flaw could cause the template parser to improperly interpret the contents of `<script>` contexts, causing actions to be improperly escaped, which could be leveraged to perform an `XSS` attack. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-693[(MTV-693)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3. It is advised to update to this version of {project-short} or later.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39318[CVE-2023-39318].

.Logs archive file downloaded from UI includes logs related to deleted migration plan/VM

In previous releases of {project-short} {project-version}, the log files downloaded from UI could contain logs that are related to a previous migration plan. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-783[(MTV-783)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3.

.Extending a VM disk in RHV is not reflected in the MTV inventory

In previous releases of {project-short} {project-version}, the size of disks that are extended in RHV was not adequately monitored. This resulted in the inability to migrate virtual machines with extended disks from a RHV provider. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-830[(MTV-830)]

This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.5.3.


.Filesystem overhead configurable

In previous releases of {project-short} {project-version}, the filesystem overhead for new persistent volumes was hard-coded to 10%. The overhead was insufficient for certain filesystem types, resulting in failures during cold-migrations from RHV and OSP to the cluster where {project-short} is deployed.  In other filesystem types, the hard-coded overhead was too high, resulting in excessive storage consumption.

In {project-short} 2.5.3, the filesystem overhead can be configured and is no longer hard-coded. If your migration allocates persistent volumes without CDI, you can adjust the file system overhead. You adjust the file system overhead by adding the following label and value to the `spec` portion of the `forklift-controller ` CR`:

[source, YAML]
----
spec:
  `controller_filesystem_overhead: <percentage>` <1>
----
<1> The percentage of overhead. If this label is not added, the default value of 10% is used. This setting is valid only if the `storageclass` is `filesystem`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-699[(MTV-699)]


.Ensure up-to-date data is displayed in the create and update provider forms

In previous releases of {project-short}, the create and update provider forms could have presented stale data.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, the new forms of create and update provider display up-to-date properties of the provider. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-603[(MTV-603)]

.Snapshots that are created during a migration in OpenStack are not deleted

In previous releases of {project-short}, the `Migration Controller` service did not delete snapshots that were created during a migration of source virtual machines in OpenStack automatically.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, all the snapshots created during the migration are removed after the migration has been completed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-620[(MTV-620)]

.{rhv-short} snapshots are not deleted after a successful migration

In previous releases of {project-short}, the `Migration Controller` service did not delete snapshots automatically after a successful warm migration of a VM from {rhv-short}.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, the snapshots generated during migration are removed after a successful migration, and the original snapshots are not removed after a successful migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-349[(MTV-349)]

.Warm migration fails when cutover conflicts with precopy

In previous releases of {project-short}, the cutover operation failed when it was triggered while precopy was being performed. The VM was locked in {rhv-short} and therefore the `ovirt-engine` rejected the snapshot creation, or disk transfer, operation.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, the cutover operation is triggered, but it is not performed at that time because the VM is locked. Once the precopy operation completes, the cutover operation is triggered. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-686[(MTV-686)]

.Warm migration fails when VM is locked

In previous releases of {project-short}, triggering a warm migration while there was an ongoing operation in {rhv-short} that locked the VM caused the migration to fail because the snapshot creation could not be triggered.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, warm migration does not fail when an operation that locks the VM is performed in {rhv-short}. The migration does not fail, but starts when the VM is unlocked. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-687[(MTV-687)]

.Deleting migrated VM does not remove PVC and PV

In previous releases of {project-short}, when removing a VM that was migrated, its persistent volume claims (PVCs) and physical volumes (PV) were not deleted.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, PVCs and PVs are deleted when deleting migrated VM.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-492[(MTV-492)]

.PVC deletion hangs after archiving and deleting migration plan

In previous releases of {project-short}, when a migration failed, its PVCs and PVs were not deleted as expected when its migration plan was archived and deleted.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, PVCs are deleted when archiving and deleting migration plan.link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-493[(MTV-493)]

.VM with multiple disks may boot from non-bootable disk after migration

In previous releases of {project-short}, VM with multiple disks that were migrated might not have been able to boot on the target {ocp} cluster.

This issue is resolved in {project-short} {project-version}, VM with multiple disks that are migrated are able to boot on the target {ocp} cluster. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-433[(MTV-433)]


.Transfer network not taken into account for cold migrations from vSphere
In {project-short} releases 2.4.0-2.5.3, cold migrations from vSphere to the local cluster on which {project-short} was deployed did not take a specified transfer network into account. This issue is resolved in  {project-short} 2.5.4.  link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-846[(MTV-846)]

== Upgrade notes

// Is there anything else you want me to add?
It is recommended to upgrade from {project-short} 2.4.2 to {project-short} {project-version}.

.Upgrade from 2.4.0 fails

When upgrading from MTV 2.4.0 to a later version, the operation fails with an error that says the field 'spec.selector' of deployment `forklift-controller` is immutable. Workaround: Remove the custom resource `forklift-controller` of type `ForkliftController` from the installed namespace, and recreate it. Refresh the {ocp} console once the `forklift-console-plugin` pod runs to load the upgraded {project-short} web console. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-518[(MTV-518)]
