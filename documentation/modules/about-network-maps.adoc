= About network maps in migration plans

[role="_abstract"]
Create network maps in {project-first} to map source networks to {virt} networks. Plan-specific maps are owned by that plan and created in the Plan creation wizard. Ownerless maps can be used by any plan and are created in the Network maps page; they are copied when selected for a plan.
