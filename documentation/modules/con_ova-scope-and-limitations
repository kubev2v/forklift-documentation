= OVA scope and limitations

[role="_abstract"]

OVA import for vendor appliances is designed to migrate VMs whose operating systems are exported from {vmw} vSphere. These kinds of VMs can be migrated successfully to {virt} by {project-first}, because `virt-v2v`, the tool used by {project-short} to convert VMs to run on {virt}, supports their operating systems. 

Many third-party vendor-supplied OVA appliances, such as F5, Cisco, and Netscaler, use proprietary bootloaders or disk layouts. As a result, these appliances often fail the `virt-v2v` conversion step with errors such as "no bootloader detected" or disk layout incompatibilities. Even setting `skipGuestConversion` to `true` with these appliances often fails with a blank PVC rather than a raw data copy of the disk bits. Additionally, converting a third-party vendor OVA might invalidate support agreements

To avoid these problems, if your OVAs are third-party applications, request the vendor's native `.qcow2` and import the OVAs directly to {virt} using the {virt} "Upload image" or "Import from URL" features rather than using {project-short}.
