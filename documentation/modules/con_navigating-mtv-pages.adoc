The {project-first} user interface provides several main pages to help you manage your VM migrations.

You can access {project-short} in the {ocp-short} web console by clicking *Migration for Virtualization* in the left navigation menu under the *Virtualization* section.

The main pages include:

*Providers*:: View and manage your source and target virtualization providers. Add new providers, test connections, and monitor provider health.

*Migration plans*:: Create, view, and manage migration plans. Monitor the status of running migrations and view migration history. Access the plan details page to configure settings, select VMs, and customize migration parameters.

*Mappings for virtualization*:: Create and manage network and storage mappings that define how source resources map to target resources in the destination environment.

*Overview* (administrators only):: View system-wide migration statistics, health information, and configure {project-short} settings. This page provides charts showing migration history, VM status, and plan status across all migrations.

Each page provides filtering, sorting, and search capabilities to help you manage your resources efficiently.
