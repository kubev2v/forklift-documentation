[id="increasing-nfc-memory-vmware-host_{context}"]
= Increasing the NFC service memory of an ESXi host

If you are migrating more than 10 VMs from an ESXi host in the same migration plan, you must increase the NFC service memory of the host. Otherwise,the migration will fail because the NFC service memory is limited to 10 parallel connections.

.Procedure

. Log in to the ESXi host as root.
. Change the value of `maxMemory` to `1000000000` in `/etc/vmware/hostd/config.xml`:
+
[source,xml]
----
...
      <nfcsvc>
         <path>libnfcsvc.so</path>
         <enabled>true</enabled>
         <maxMemory>1000000000</maxMemory>
         <maxStreamMemory>10485760</maxStreamMemory>
      </nfcsvc>
...
----

. Restart `hostd`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# /etc/init.d/hostd restart
----
+
You do not need to reboot the host.
