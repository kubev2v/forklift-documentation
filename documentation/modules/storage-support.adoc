= Storage support and default modes

[role="_abstract"]
{project-first} uses the following default volume and access modes for supported storage.

[NOTE]
====
If the {virt} storage does not support {ocp-doc}/storage/dynamic-provisioning#dynamic-provisioning[dynamic provisioning], you must apply the following settings:

* `Filesystem` volume mode
+
`Filesystem` volume mode is slower than `Block` volume mode.
* `ReadWriteOnce` access mode
+
`ReadWriteOnce` access mode does not support live virtual machine migration.

See {ocp-doc}/virtualization/storage#virt-configuring-storage-profile[Configuring storage profiles] for details on applying settings to a storage profile.
====

[NOTE]
====
If your migration uses block storage and persistent volumes created with an EXT4 file system, increase the file system overhead in the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to be more than 10%. The default overhead that is assumed by CDI does not completely include the reserved place for the root partition. If you do not increase the file system overhead in CDI by this amount, your migration might fail.
====

[NOTE]
====
When you migrate from {osp}, or when you run a cold migration from {rhv-full} to the {ocp} cluster that {project-short} is deployed on, the migration allocates persistent volumes without CDI. In these cases, you might need to adjust the file system overhead.

If the configured file system overhead, which has a default value of 10%, is too low, the disk transfer will fail due to lack of space. In such a case, you would want to increase the file system overhead.

In some cases, however, you might want to decrease the file system overhead to reduce storage consumption.

You can change the file system overhead by changing the value of the `controller_filesystem_overhead` in the `spec` portion of the `forklift-controller` CR, as described in xref:configuring-mtv-operator_{context}[Configuring the MTV Operator].
