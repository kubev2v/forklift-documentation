[WARNING]
====
For virtual machines (VMs) running Microsoft Windows, Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) inside the guest VM is used to quiesce the file system and applications. 

When performing a warm migration of a Microsoft Windows virtual machine from VMware, you must start VSS on the Windows guest OS in order for the snapshot and `Quiesce guest file system` to succeed.

If you do not start VSS on the Windows guest OS, the snapshot creation during the Warm migration fails with the following error:

[source,terminal]
----
An error occurred while taking a snapshot: Failed to restart the virtual machine
----

If you set the VSS service to `Manual` and start a snapshot creation with `Quiesce guest file system = yes`. In the background, the VMware Snapshot provider service requests VSS to start the shadow copy.
