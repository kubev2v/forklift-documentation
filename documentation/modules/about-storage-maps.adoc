= About storage maps in migration plans

[role="_abstract"]
Create storage maps in {project-first} to map source disk storages to {virt} storage classes. Plan-specific maps are owned by that plan and created in the Plan creation wizard. Ownerless maps can be used by any plan and are created in the Storage maps page; they are copied when selected for a plan.
