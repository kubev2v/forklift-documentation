= OVA scope and limitations

[role="_abstract"]

OVA migration is validated for migrating supported guest operating systems exported from {vmw} vSphere. For third-party networking or security appliances, check with the vendor for native QCOW2 or KVM images.

The OVA import process utilizes `virt-v2v` to prepare guest operating systems for KVM. Vendor-supplied appliances often use proprietary bootloaders or disk layouts that are incompatible with this conversion. Moreover, converting a vendor OVA may invalidate vendor support agreements. 

To ensure stability and vendor support, always prioritize importing the vendor's native QCOW2 image by using either the {virt} "Upload Image" or the {virt} "Import from URL" workflow rather than using the {project-first} OVA path.
