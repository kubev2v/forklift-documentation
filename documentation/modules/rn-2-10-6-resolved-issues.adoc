Review the resolved issues in this release of {project-short}.

Migrations with shared disk migration disabled failed::

In {project-short}, migration of shared disks is done by running two migration plans, one with the `migrateSharedDisk` option set to `true` and one with the option set to `false`. Before this update, the migration plan with the option set to `false` failed because an unnecessary `populator` pod was created. With this release, the unnecessary pod is not created, and migration of shared disks works as expected.
