= Known issue: Cyclic shared disk dependencies

[role="_abstract"]
A known issue for migrating shared disks is that virtual machines (VMs) with cyclic shared disk dependencies cannot be migrated successfully.

* Explanation: When `migrateSharedDisks` is set to `true`, {project-short} migrates each VM in the plan, one by one, and any shared disks attached to it, without determining if a shared disk was already migrated. 

In the case of 2 VMs sharing one disk, there is no problem. {project-short} transfers the shared disk and attaches the 2 VMs to the shared disk after the migration. 

However, if there is a cyclic dependency of shared disks between 3 or more VMs, {project-short} either duplicates or omits one of the shared disks. The figure that follows illustrates the simplest version of this problem.

In this case, the VMs and shared disks cannot be migrated in the same `Plan` CR. Although this problem could be solved using `migrateSharedDisks` and 2 `Plan` CRs, it illustrates the basic issue that must be avoided in migrating VMs with shared disks.
