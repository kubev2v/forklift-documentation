= Adding a {vmw} vSphere source provider

[role="_abstract"] 
You can migrate {vmw} vSphere VMs from {vmw} vCenter or from a {vmw} ESX/ESXi server without going through vCenter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
EMS enforcement is disabled for migrations with {vmw} vSphere source providers in order to enable migrations from versions of vSphere that are supported by {project-full} but do not comply with the 2023 FIPS requirements. Therefore, users should consider whether migrations from vSphere source providers risk their compliance with FIPS. Supported versions of vSphere are specified in xref:compatibility-guidelines_mtv[Software compatibility guidelines].

ifdef::rhv[]
= Adding {a-rhv} source provider

[role="_abstract"] 
You can add {a-rhv} source provider by using the {ocp} web console.
endif::[]

ifdef::ova[]
= Adding an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) source provider

[role="_abstract"] 
You can add Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files that were created by {vmw} vSphere as a source provider by using the {ocp} web console.

endif::[]

ifdef::ostack[]
= Adding an {osp} source provider

[role="_abstract"] 
You can add an {osp} source provider by using the {ocp} web console.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you migrate an image-based VM from an {osp} provider, a snapshot is created for the image that is attached to the source VM, and the data from the snapshot is copied over to the target VM. This means that the target VM will have the same state as that of the source VM at the time the snapshot was created.

ifdef::cnv[]
= Adding a Red Hat {virt} source provider

[role="_abstract"] 
You can use a Red Hat {virt} provider as both a source provider and a destination provider.

Specifically, the host cluster that is automatically added as a {virt} provider can be used as both a source provider and a destination provider.

You can migrate VMs from the cluster that {project-short} is deployed on to another cluster, or from a remote cluster to the cluster that {project-short} is deployed on.

[NOTE]
====
The {ocp} cluster version of the source provider must be 4.16 or later.

ifdef::dest_vmware,dest_rhv,dest_ostack,dest_ova,dest_cnv[]
= Adding {a-virt} destination provider

[role="_abstract"] 
You can use a Red Hat {virt} provider as both a source provider and a destination provider.

Specifically, the host cluster that is automatically added as a {virt} provider can be used as both a source provider and a destination provider.

You can also add another {virt} destination provider to the {ocp} web console in addition to the default {virt} destination provider, which is the cluster where you installed {project-short}.

You can migrate VMs from the cluster that {project-short} is deployed on to another cluster or from a remote cluster to the cluster that {project-short} is deployed on.

.Prerequisites
endif::[]

ifdef::vmware[]
* It is strongly recommended to create a {vmw} Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) image in a secure registry that is accessible to all clusters. A VDDK image accelerates migration and reduces the risk of a plan failing. If you are not using VDDK and a plan fails, retry with VDDK installed. For more information, see xref:creating-vddk-image_mtv[Creating a VDDK image].

include::snip-vsan.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifdef::rhv[]
* {manager} CA certificate, unless it was replaced by a third-party certificate, in which case, specify the {manager} Apache CA certificate
endif::[]

ifdef::dest_vmware,dest_rhv,dest_ostack,dest_ova,dest_cnv[]
* You must have {a-virt} service account token with `cluster-admin` privileges. For more information on service account tokens, see {ocp-doc}/authentication_and_authorization/using-service-accounts#service-accounts-overview_using-service-accounts[Service accounts overview].

. Access the *Create provider* page for {vmw} by doing one of the following:

.. In the {ocp} web console, click *Migration for Virtualization > Providers*.
... Click *Create Provider*.
... Select a *Project* from the list. The default project shown depends on the active project of {project-short}.
+
If the active project is *All projects*, then the default project is `openshift-mtv`. Otherwise, the default project is the same as the active project.
+
If you have Administrator privileges, you can see all projects, otherwise, you can see only the projects you are authorized to work with.

... Click *{vmw}*.

.. If you have Administrator privileges, in the {ocp} web console, click *Migration for Virtualization > Overview*.
... In the *Welcome* pane, click *{vmw}*.
+ 
If the *Welcome* pane is not visible, click *Show the welcome card* in the upper-right corner of the page, and click *{vmw}* when the *Welcome* pane opens.
... Select a *Project* from the list. The default project shown depends on the active project of {project-short}.
+
If the active project is *All projects*, then the default project is `openshift-mtv`. Otherwise, the default project is the same as the active project.
+
If you have Administrator privileges, you can see all projects, otherwise, you can see only the projects you are authorized to work with.

. Specify the following fields:
+
.. *Provider details*

* *Provider resource name*: Name of the source provider.
* *Endpoint type*: Select the vSphere provider endpoint type. Options: *vCenter* or *ESXi*. You can migrate virtual machines from vCenter, an ESX/ESXi server that is not managed by vCenter, or from an ESX/ESXi server that is managed by vCenter but does not go through vCenter.
* *URL*: URL of the SDK endpoint of the vCenter on which the source VM is mounted. Ensure that the URL includes the `sdk` path, usually `/sdk`. For example, `https://vCenter-host-example.com/sdk`. If a certificate for FQDN is specified, the value of this field needs to match the FQDN in the certificate.
* *VDDK init image*: `VDDKInitImage` path. It is strongly recommended to create a VDDK init image to accelerate migrations. For more information, see xref:creating-vddk-image_mtv[Creating a VDDK image].
+
Do one of the following:

** Select the *Skip VMWare Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) SDK acceleration (not recommended)*.

** Enter the path in the *VDDK init image* text box. Format: `<registry_route_or_server_path>/vddk:<tag>`.

** Upload a VDDK archive and build a VDDK init image from the archive by doing the following:

*** Click *Browse* next to the *VDDK init image archive* text box, select the desired file, and click *Select*.

*** Click *Upload*.
+
The URL of the uploaded archive is displayed in the *VDDK init image archive* text box.

.. *Provider credentials*

* *Username*: vCenter user or ESXi user. For example, `user@vsphere.local`.
* *Password*: vCenter user password or ESXi user password.
