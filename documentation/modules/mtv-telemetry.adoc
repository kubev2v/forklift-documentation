Red Hat uses telemetry to collect anonymous usage data from {project-first} installations to help us improve the usability and efficiency of {project-short}.

{project-short} collects the following data:

* Migration plan status: The number of migrations. Includes those that failed, succeeded, or were canceled.
* Provider: The number of migrations per provider. Includes {rhv-full}, vSphere, {osp}, OVA, and {virt} providers.
* Mode: The number of migrations by mode. Includes cold and warm migrations.
* Target: The number of migrations by target. Includes local and remote migrations.
* Plan ID: The ID number of the migration plan. The number is assigned by {project-short}.

Metrics are calculated every 10 seconds and are reported per week, per month, and per year.
