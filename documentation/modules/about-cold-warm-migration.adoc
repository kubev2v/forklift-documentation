= About cold and warm migration

{project-short} supports cold migration from {rhv-full} and warm migration from VMware vSphere.

[id="cold-migration_{context}"]
== Cold migration

Cold migration is the default migration type. The source virtual machines are shut down while the data is copied.

[id="warm-migration_{context}"]
== Warm migration

Most of the data is copied during the _precopy_ stage while the source virtual machines (VMs) are running.

Then the VMs are shut down and the remaining data is copied during the _cutover_ stage.

.Precopy stage

The VMs are not shut down during the precopy stage.

The VM disks are copied incrementally using link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128[changed block tracking (CBT)] snapshots. The snapshots are created at one-hour intervals by default. You can change the snapshot interval by updating the `forklift-controller` deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must enable CBT on the source VMs and the VM disks.

A VM can support up to 28 CBT snapshots. If the source VM already has too many CBT snapshots and the Migration Controller is not able to create a new one, warm migration may fail. The Migration Controller will clean up each snapshot it creates after it is finished with it.
====

The precopy stage runs indefinitely until the cutover stage is reached.

.Cutover stage

The VMs are shut down during the cutover stage and the remaining data is migrated. Data stored in RAM is not migrated.

You can start the cutover stage manually in the {project-short} console.

You can schedule a cutover time by specifying the value of the `cutover` parameter in the `Migration` CR manifest.
