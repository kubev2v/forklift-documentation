VMware only: In cold migrations, in situations in which a package manager cannot be used during the migration, {project-short} does not install the `qemu-guest-agent` daemon on the migrated VMs. This has some impact on the functionality of the migrated VMs, but overall, they are still expected to function.

To enable {project-short} to automatically install `qemu-guest-agent` on the migrated VMs, ensure that your package manager can install the daemon during the first boot of the VM after migration.

If that is not possible, use your preferred automated or manual procedure to install `qemu-guest-agent` manually.
