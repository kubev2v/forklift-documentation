== ESXi performance

.Single ESXi performance

Test migration using the same ESXi host.

In each iteration, the total VMs are increased, to display the impact of concurrent migration on the duration.

The results show that migration time is linear when increasing the total VMs (50 GiB disk, Utilization 70%).

The optimal number of VMs per ESXi is 10.

.Multi ESXi hosts and single data store

In each iteration, the number of ESXi hosts were increased, to show that increasing the number of ESXi hosts improves the migration time.

[id="mtv-different-migration-network_{context}"]
== Different migration network performance

Each iteration the `Migration Network`  was changed, using the *Provider*, to find the fastest network for migration.

The results show that there is no degradation using management compared to non-managment networks when all interfaces and network speeds are the same.
