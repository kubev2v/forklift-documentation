== Removing VMware tools from Windows guests

Virt-v2v attempts to remove VMware Tools. For Windows guests, this is meant to happen during the first boot after conversion.

We use VMware's recommended uninstallation method as that is the safest choice. However, this method has been known to fail. If it does fail, VMware Tools must be removed by another method.

For example, you can use a method, such as the one described here link:https://gist.github.com/broestls/f872872a00acee2fca02017160840624[Force removal of VMware Tools, Program Files, and Windows Services].
