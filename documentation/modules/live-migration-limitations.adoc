= Limitations of live migration

[role="_abstract"]
Live migration lets you migrate virtual machines (VMs) between {virt} clusters with a minimum of downtime, but the feature does have the following limitations:

* Live migration is available *_only_* for migrations between {virt} clusters. It is not available for any other source provider, whether the provider is supported by {project-first} or not.
* Live migration does not establish connectivity between {virt} clusters. Establishing such connectivity is the responsibility of the cluster administrator.
* Live migration does not migrate resources unrelated to VMs, such as services, routes, or other application components, that may be necessary for application availability after a migration.
