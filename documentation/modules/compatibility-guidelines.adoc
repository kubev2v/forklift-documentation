.Compatible software versions
|===
|{project-full} |{ocp} |{virt} |VMware vSphere |{rhv-full}|OpenStack
|{project-version} |{ocp-y-version} |{ocp-y-version} |6.5 or later |4.4 SP1 or later|16.1 or later

[NOTE]
====
{project-short} was tested only with {rhv-full} (RHV) 4.4 SP1.
Migration from {rhv-full} ({rhv-short}) 4.3 has not been tested with {project-short} {project-version}. While not supported, basic migrations from {rhv-short} 4.3 are expected to work.

Generally it is advised to upgrade {rhv-full} Manager (RHVM) to the previously mentioned supported version before the migration to {virt}.

Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade {rhv-short} to the supported version above before the migration to {virt}.

However, migrations from {rhv-short} 4.3.11 were tested with {project-short} 2.3, and may work in practice in many environments using {project-short} {project-version}. In this case, we advise upgrading {rhv-full} Manager (RHVM) to the previously mentioned supported version before the migration to {virt}.
