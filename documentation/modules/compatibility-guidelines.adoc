[NOTE]
.Migration from {rhv-full} 4.3
====
{project-short} 2.6 was tested only with {rhv-full} (RHV) 4.4 SP1.
Migration from {rhv-full} ({rhv-short}) 4.3 has not been tested with {project-short} {project-version}. While not supported, basic migrations from RHV 4.3 are expected to work.

As {rhv-short} 4.3 lacks the improvements that were introduced in {rhv-short} 4.4 for {project-short}, and new features were not tested with {rhv-short} 4.3, migrations from {rhv-short} 4.3 may not function at the same level as migrations from {rhv-short} 4.4, with some functionality may be missing.

Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade {rhv-short} to the supported version above before the migration to {virt}.

However, migrations from {rhv-short} 4.3.11 were tested with {project-short} 2.3, and may work in practice in many environments using {project-short} {project-version}. In this case, we advise upgrading {rhv-full} Manager (RHVM) to the previously mentioned supported version before the migration to {virt}.
