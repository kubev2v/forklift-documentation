[role="_abstract"]
Review the resolved issues in this release of {project-short}.

Heading::
In previous versions of {project-short}, you could not rename virtual machines (VMs) from the source provider to address naming conflicts before the VMs were migrated to Red Hat {virt}. In this release of {project-short}, you can modify non-compliant VM names in the {project-short} UI during the migration process to address naming conflicts and ensure compatibility with {virt} naming conventions.
