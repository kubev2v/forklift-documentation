= Creating custom rules for the Validation service

[role="_abstract"]
The `Validation` service uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy rules to check the suitability of each virtual machine (VM) for migration. The `Validation` service generates a list of _concerns_ for each VM, which are stored in the `Provider Inventory` service as VM attributes. The web console displays the concerns for each VM in the provider inventory.

You can create custom rules to extend the default ruleset of the `Validation` service. For example, you can create a rule that checks whether a VM has multiple disks.
