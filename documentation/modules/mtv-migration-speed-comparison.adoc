= Migration speed comparison

[role="_abstract"]
Compare cold and warm migration speeds to choose the best migration type for your workload. Both have similar transfer speeds, but warm migration runs in the background with hourly snapshots while cold migration requires VM shutdown.

[NOTE]
====
Live migration reduces downtime even further than warm migration, but live migration is available only for migration between {virt} clusters or between namespaces on the same {virt} cluster. Therefore it is not included in the comparison above.
