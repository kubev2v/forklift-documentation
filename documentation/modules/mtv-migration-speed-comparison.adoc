= Migration speed comparison

[role="_abstract"]
Warm and cold migrations have similar transfer and conversion speeds. Warm migration transfers snapshots in the background while VMs run. Default snapshots occur every 60 minutes; substantial VM changes require more data transfer than cold migration. Cutover time depends on changes since the last snapshot.

[NOTE]
====
Live migration reduces downtime even further than warm migration, but live migration is available only for migration between {virt} clusters or between namespaces on the same {virt} cluster. Therefore it is not included in the comparison above.
