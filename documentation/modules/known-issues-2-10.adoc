{project-first} 2.10 has the following known issues:

.Raw Device Mapping files prevent `copyoffload` migration of NFS-based VMs

If you try to migrate an NFS-based VM by using the `copyoffload` method, the `vmkfstools` command-line utility attempts to use the fallback method because NFS is file-based. However, NFS datastores do not support Raw Device Mapping (RDM) pointer files, and `vmkfstools` creates RDM files as cloning targets. 

*Workaround:* You can use one of the following migration methods to address the limitation:

* Migrate the NFS-based VM to an iSCSI or FC datastore, and then use the `copyoffload` method to migrate the VM to {virt}.
* Migrate the VM to a local ESXi disk datastore, and then use the `copyoffload` fallback method to migrate the VM to {virt}.
* Use either the HTTP or VDDK method to migrate the VM to {virt}.

.Inaccurate `ConnectionTestFailed` error messages when creating an OVA provider

When you create an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) provider in the MTV UI, `ConnectionTestFailed` error messages are displayed before the provider status changes to `Ready`. The error messages are misleading and do not accurately reflect in-progress status of the connection. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3613[(MTV-3613)]
