= Using application credential authentication with an {osp} source provider

You can use application credential authentication, instead of username and password authentication, when you create an {osp} source provider.

{project-short} supports both of the following types of application credential authentication:

* Application credential ID
* Application credential name

For each type of application credential authentication, you need to use data from OpenStack to create a `Secret` manifest.

.Prerequisites

You have an {osp} account.

.Procedure

. In the dashboard of the {osp} web console, click *Project* > *API Access*.
. Expand *Download OpenStack RC file* and click *OpenStack RC file*.
+
The file that is downloaded, referred to here as `<openstack_rc_file>`, includes the following fields used for application credential authentication:
+
[source, terminal]
----
OS_AUTH_URL
OS_PROJECT_ID
OS_PROJECT_NAME
OS_DOMAIN_NAME
OS_USERNAME
----

. To get the data needed for application credential authentication, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack application credential create --role member --role reader --secret redhat forklift
----
+
The output, referred to here as `<openstack_credential_output>`, includes:
+
* The `id`  and `secret` that you need for authentication using an application credential ID
* The `name` and `secret` that you need for authentication using an application credential name

. Create a `Secret` manifest similar to the following:

** For authentication using the application credential ID:
+
[source,yaml]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openstack-secret-appid
  namespace: openshift-mtv
  labels:
    createdForProviderType: openstack
type: Opaque
stringData:
  authType: applicationcredential
  applicationCredentialID: <id_from_openstack_credential_output>
  applicationCredentialSecret: <secret_from_openstack_credential_output>
  url: <OS_AUTH_URL_from_openstack_rc_file>
EOF
----

** For authentication using the application credential name:
+
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openstack-secret-appname
  namespace: openshift-mtv
  labels:
    createdForProviderType: openstack
type: Opaque
stringData:
  authType: applicationcredential
  applicationCredentialName: <name_from_openstack_credential_output>
  applicationCredentialSecret: <secret_from_openstack_credential_output>
  domainName: <OS_DOMAIN_NAME_from_openstack_rc_file>
  username: <OS_USERNAME_from_openstack_rc_file>
  url: <OS_AUTH_URL_from_openstack_rc_file>
EOF
----

. Continue migrating your virtual machine according to the procedure in xref:migrating-virtual-machines-from-cli[Migrating virtual machines], starting with step 2, "Create a `Provider` manifest for the source provider."
