= Device compatibility mode for raw copy migrations

[role="_abstract"]
When you use raw copy mode, you can configure which device types {project-short} uses for migrated VMs through the *Use compatibility mode* setting.

Compatibility devices (default)::
By default, when you enable raw copy mode, {project-short} uses compatibility devices to ensure VMs can boot on {virt}:
+
* SATA bus for disk controllers
* E1000E NICs for network interfaces
* USB controllers
+
These emulated devices work without requiring additional drivers in the guest operating system, ensuring maximum bootability for migrated VMs.

VirtIO devices::
For source VMs that already have VirtIO drivers installed, you can disable compatibility mode to use VirtIO devices instead. VirtIO devices provide better performance:
+
* VirtIO disk bus provides higher I/O throughput than SATA
* VirtIO network interface provides better network performance than E1000E
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The *Use compatibility mode* setting only applies when you enable raw copy mode. When you disable raw copy mode (standard V2V conversion), {project-short} always uses VirtIO devices regardless of this setting.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
Before you disable compatibility mode, verify that VirtIO drivers are installed in the source VM. VMs without VirtIO drivers do not boot on {virt} if you disable compatibility mode.
====

When to disable compatibility mode::
Consider disabling compatibility mode when:
+
* Your source VMs are running modern operating systems with VirtIO drivers pre-installed, for example, recent versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Windows with VirtIO drivers
* Maximum performance is required for your workload
* You have verified VirtIO driver presence in the source VM before migration

Configuring compatibility mode::
You can configure the compatibility mode setting when you create a migration plan. For more information, see link:{mtv-plan}assembly_planning-migration-vmware_mtv#configuring-plan-settings-vmware_vmware[Configuring VMware migration plan settings].
