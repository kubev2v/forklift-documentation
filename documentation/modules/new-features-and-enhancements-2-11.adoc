{project-first} 2.11 introduces the following features and enhancements.

Customizable service account for pre-plan and post-plan hooks in Create migration plan pages::

In {project-short} 2.11.0, users can set a service account name for pre-plan and post-plan hooks in the Create migration plan pages. This UI setting allows for greater flexibility and control over the service accounts used in these hooks, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to manage cluster resources. The `Service account` field is a free text field as the service account information is not stored in the inventory for a remote cluster. This enhancement improves the overall security and customization of the user's deployment.

Improved data migration error handling and diagnostics::

{project-short} 2.11.0 enhances data integrity during VM migration by using features introduced in RHEL 10.1. This release introduces filesystem-level consistency checks, improved system error handling, and internal diagnostics. Warm migration and features like storage offload minimize downtime with efficient disk migration and data transfer.

Technology Preview: Storage Offload Copy optimization for network usage::

In {project-short} 2.11.0, the Storage Offload Copy feature for warm and cold migrations accelerates disk transfer in the storage array by bypassing the network, enabling snapshot creation and base disk copying while the VM is running. Delta changes can be copied over the network post-base disk storage offload copy, reducing the need for VM shutdowns. Storage Offload Copy results in reduced network usage for delta changes, improved overall performance, and enhanced migration efficiency.
