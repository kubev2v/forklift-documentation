= {rhv-full} prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to {rhv-full} migrations:

* You must have one of the following:
** {rhv-short} admin permissions. These permissions allow you to migrate any virtual machine in the system.
** `DiskCreator` and `UserVmManager` permissions. These permissions have to be granted to you individually by an `admin` user per each individual virtual machine that you want to migrate.
* You must use a xref:compatibility-guidelines_{context}[compatible version] of {rhv-full}.
* You must have the {manager} CA certificate, unless it was replaced by a third-party certificate, in which case, specify the {manager} Apache CA certificate.
+
You can obtain the {manager}  CA certificate by navigating to https://<engine_host>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA in a browser.

* If you are migrating a virtual machine with a direct LUN disk, ensure that the nodes in the {virt} destination cluster that the VM is expected to run on can access the backend storage.
