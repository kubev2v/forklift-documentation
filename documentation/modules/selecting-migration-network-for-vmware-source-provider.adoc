= Selecting a migration network for a VMware source provider

You can select a migration network in the {ocp} web console for a source provider to reduce risk to the source environment and to improve performance.

Using the default network for migration can result in poor performance because the network might not have sufficient bandwidth. This situation can have a negative effect on the source platform because the disk transfer operation might saturate the network.

[NOTE]
====
If you input any value of maximum transmission unit (MTU) besides the default value in your migration network, you must also input the same value in the {ocp-short} transfer network that you use. For more information about the {ocp-short} transfer network, see xref:creating-migration-plan-2-8_{context}[Creating a migration plan].
====

.Prerequisites

* The migration network must have sufficient throughput, minimum speed of 10 Gbps, for disk transfer.
* The migration network must be accessible to the {virt} nodes through the default gateway.
+
[NOTE]
====
The source virtual disks are copied by a pod that is connected to the pod network of the target namespace.
====

* The migration network should have jumbo frames enabled.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, click *Migration* -> *Providers for virtualization*.
. Click the host number in the *Hosts* column beside a provider to view a list of hosts.
. Select one or more hosts and click *Select migration network*.
. Specify the following fields:

* *Network*: Network name
* *ESXi host admin username*: For example, `root`
* *ESXi host admin password*: Password

. Click *Save*.
. Verify that the status of each host is *Ready*.
+
If a host status is not *Ready*, the host might be unreachable on the migration network or the credentials might be incorrect. You can modify the host configuration and save the changes.
