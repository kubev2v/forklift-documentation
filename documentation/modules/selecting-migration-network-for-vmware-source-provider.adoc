= Selecting a migration network for a VMware source provider

You can select a migration network in the {project-short} web console for a source provider to reduce risk to the source environment and to improve performance.

Using the default network for migration can result in poor performance because the network might not have sufficient bandwidth. This situation can have a negative effect on the source platform because the disk transfer operation might saturate the network.

.Prerequisites

* The migration network must have sufficient throughput, minimum speed of 10 Gbps, for disk transfer.
* The migration network must be accessible to the {virt} nodes through the default gateway.
+
[NOTE]
====
The source virtual disks are copied by a pod that is connected to the pod network of the target namespace.
====

* The migration network must have jumbo frames enabled.

.Procedure

. In the {project-short} web console, click *Providers*
. Click the *VMware* tab.
. Click the host number in the *Hosts* column beside a provider to view a list of hosts.
. Select one or more hosts and click *Select migration network*.
. Select a *Network*.
+
You can clear the selection by selecting the default network.

. If your source provider is VMware, complete the following fields:
* *ESXi host admin username*: Specify the ESXi host admin user, for example, `root`.
* *ESXi host admin password*: Specify the ESXi host admin password.
. Click *Save*.
. Verify that the status of each host is *Ready*.
+
If a host status is not *Ready*, the host might be unreachable on the migration network or the credentials might be incorrect. You can modify the host configuration and save the changes.
