{project-first} 2.8 has the following known issues:

.Failed to boot VM that needs legacy drivers after migrating from vSphere
When migrating a virtual machine (VM) that requires legacy drivers, such as Windows Server 2008 R2, from vSphere to an {ocp} cluster, the migration plan succeeds, but the VM fails to boot. This is because `virt-v2v` does not include the necessary VirtIOÂ drivers for the legacy Windows version. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3227[(MTV-3227)]

.Trusted Platform Module is added to the BIOS of a Windows Server 2022 VM after warm migration
After warm migration of Windows Server 2022 virtual machine (VM) from vSphere to an {ocp-name} cluster, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) device is added to the target VMs, even if the TPM configuration is non-persistent in the BIOS setting of the source Windows Server 2022 VM. This prevents the target VM from starting. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2049[(MTV-2049)]

.Linux VM with clustered file systems are not supported
Linux guest VMs with clustered file systems on a shared disk are not supported, as these disks are not added to the guest conversion process. The `virt-v2v` tool does not update shared disks in the `fstab` configuration file. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2145[(MTV-2145)]

.Migrating shared boot disks is not available
Migrating shared boot disks by using {project-short} is not available. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2201[(MTV-2201)]

.Anti-virus software on VMware VMs can cause migrations to fail
VMware only: Anti-virus software can cause VMware migrations to fail. It is strongly recommended to remove such software from source VMs before you start a migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2452[(MTV-2452)]

.User selections in the UI are cleared when MTV refreshes the Virtual machines page automatically
When a user tries to create a migration plan from the Virtual machines page of the UI, their selections are cleared when {project-short} refreshes the page automatically. To avoid this problem, create the plan by completing the YAML in the *YAML* tab of the plan's *Plan details* page, or create the plan by using the CLI. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2621[(MTV-2621)]

.Network configuration scripts do not work for Windows Server 2008 SP2
VMware: Network configuration scripts do not work for Windows Server 2008 SP2 VMs. The scripts return a "missing expression" error. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2664[(MTV-2664)]
