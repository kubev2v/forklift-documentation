= Error messages

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes error messages and how to resolve them.

[id="warm-import-retry-limit_{context}"]
== warm import retry limit reached

The `warm import retry limit reached` error message is displayed during a warm migration if a {vmw} virtual machine (VM) has reached the maximum number (28) of changed block tracking (CBT) snapshots during the precopy stage.

To resolve this problem, delete some of the CBT snapshots from the VM and restart the migration plan.

[id="unable-resize-disk-image_{context}"]
== Unable to resize disk image to required size

The `Unable to resize disk image to required size` error message is displayed when migration fails because a virtual machine on the target provider uses persistent volumes with an EXT4 file system on block storage. The problem occurs because the default overhead that is assumed by Containerized Data Importer (CDI) does not completely include the reserved place for the root partition.

To resolve this problem, increase the file system overhead in CDI to more than 10%.
