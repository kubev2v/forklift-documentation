Issue Key,Summary,Description,Workaround
MTV-3116,Forklift console plugin fails to load on IPv6-only OpenShift clusters,When MTV 2.9.1 is deployed on an IPv6-only OpenShift cluster, an incorrect API endpoint prevents the forklift-console-plugin from serving a valid plugin manifest, displaying the error Failed to get a valid plugin manifest from /api/plugins/forklift-console-plugins/. While the forklift-ui-plugin pod runs successfully, the console plugin cannot load, preventing access to the MTV user interface in the OpenShift web console. This issue affects all IPv6-only cluster deployments with OpenShift 4.19.7 and CNV 4.19.1.,Deploy MTV on dual-stack or IPv4 clusters until this issue is resolved.
MTV-1736,Incorrect labeling of inactive migration plans,Inactive migration plans are incorrectly labeled as Running when max_vms_inflight exceeds the total number of disks per migration. This label leads to confusion about the actual state of the plans, as all migration plans appear to be Running in the user interface.,Currently, there is no workaround for this issue.
MTV-2446,Migration between OpenShift namespaces causes MAC address collisions,During migration between OpenShift namespaces in a cluster, MAC address collisions result in VM creation failure.,Disable the KubeMacPool. For more information, see Managing KubeMacPool by using the CLI in the OpenShift documentation.
