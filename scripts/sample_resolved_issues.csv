Issue Key,Summary,Description
MTV-3915,Target cluster namespaces now visible for cross-cluster live migration,Before this update, during cross-cluster live migration, projects were fetched from the host cluster instead of the target cluster. As a consequence, target cluster namespaces were not visible in the UI, causing user inconvenience. With this release, cross-cluster live migration fetches project data from the target cluster, making target cluster namespaces visible in the UI during migration.
MTV-3618,VDDK image archive upload succeeds in private namespaces,Before this update, VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) image archive upload failure occurred in private namespaces due to incorrect namespace usage. As a consequence, users experienced VDDK image upload failure in private namespaces during source provider creation. With this release, you can upload VDDK tar archives successfully in private namespaces.
MTV-3476,Correct UI display of migration type after change,Before this update, if you changed the Migration type on the Plan details page in the MTV UI from warm to cold, the YAML file was updated correctly but the UI did not display the updated migration type. With this release, the UI edit field for Migration type updates the migration type in the YAML file and the UI correctly displays the updated migration type.
